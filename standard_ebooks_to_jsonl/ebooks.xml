		<summary type="text">An amateur sleuth visting a country house solves the mystery of who shot the man in the locked room.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Red House Mystery</i> is a detective novel by <abbr>A. A.</abbr> Milne, better known for his children’s writing, who wrote this book for his father in 1922. It is his only mystery novel and was very popular at the time.</p>
			<p>Mark Ablett is the amiable host of a country-house party to which his estranged brother, Robert, arrives from Australia. Robert is the black sheep of the family who is said to have borrowed money in the past and had written to warn of his visit. One afternoon a gunshot is heard, and Robert is found shot in the head while locked in the library, while his brother Mark has vanished. Tony Gillingham, who has arrived to visit Bill Beverley, one of the guests at the house-party, takes it upon himself to investigate the death. Together Tony and Bill form a Holmes and Watson partnership and seek to solve the mystery in an unorthodox manner, taking over from a bumbling police force.</p>
			<p><i>The Red House Mystery</i> has divided opinion on its literary merit but it remains an entertaining and intriguing read nonetheless.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of adventurers search for their friends, who were lost while exploring the otherworldly secrets of a monument discovered on a chain of island ruins.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Moon Pool</i>, in novel form, is a combination and fix-up of two previously-published short stories: “The Moon Pool,” and “Conquest of the Moon Pool.” Initially serialized in <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, Merritt made the interesting choice of framing the novel as a sort of scientific retelling, going so far as to include footnotes from fictional scientists, to give this completely fantastic work an air of authenticity.</p>
			<p>In it we find the adventuresome botanist William T. Goodwin embarking on a quest to help his friend Throckmortin, whose wife and friends have fallen victim to a mysterious temple ruin on a remote South Pacific island. A series of coincidences provides Goodwin with a colorful cast of accompanying adventurers, and they soon find themselves in a mysterious futuristic underworld.</p>
			<p><i>The Moon Pool</i> is an important entry in the Lost World genre, in no small part because it was a significant influence on H. P. Lovecraft—hints of <i>Moon Pool</i> can be seen in his short story “The Call of Cthulhu,” and hints of Merritt’s Nan-Madol can be seen in Lovecraft’s R’lyeh.</p>
			<p>Today, <i>The Moon Pool</i> is a pulp classic, featuring many of the themes, tropes, and archetypes that characterized so many of the pulp adventure works of the era.</p>

		<summary type="text">Aesop’s classic Fables of behaviour and consequence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Whether it’s the benefits of taking it slow and steady (“The Tortoise and the Hare”), the necessity of invention (“The Crow and the Pitcher”), or the problems of cognitive dissonance (“The Fox and the Grapes”), Aesop has a fable for every occasion. Aesop lived in Greece in the 6th century BCE, far enough in the past that it’s become impossible to ascribe all these fables to him. Some were certainly retellings of older myths, some share their roots in collections of fables from India and further afield, and many were added well after his time. However, they all share a certain quality of prose that marks them out as belonging to the collection regardless of authorship. It’s that quality, combined with their insight into the human character, that has meant that they’ve stood the test of time for twenty-five centuries.</p>
			<p>This collection is the 1912 translation by V. S. Vernon Jones, and is comprised of two hundred and eighty-four of the fables.</p>

		<summary type="text">The famous detective Poirot and his sidekick Hastings are summoned to France to investigate the mysterious murder of a rich businessman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Murder on the Links</i> is Agatha Christie’s second Poirot novel, featuring the brilliant Belgian detective and his sidekick, Captain Hastings.</p>
			<p>In this characteristic whodunit, Poirot is summoned to a seaside town in northern France by a desperate letter from a rich businessman, who fears that he is being stalked. Poirot arrives to find the businessman already dead, his body lying facedown in an open grave on a golf course, a knife in his back—the victim of a mysterious murder. Over the coming days Poirot clashes wits with an arrogant Parisian detective, Giraud, while Hastings finds himself pining after a beautiful but shadowy American expatriate known to him only as “Cinderella.” Together, Poirot and Hastings unravel the intricate web of mystery and deceit behind the murder.</p>
			<p>Christie based this mystery after a real-life French murder case, and it’s believed that this is the first detective novel to use the phrase “the scene of the crime.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Hercule Poirot solves the mystery of a murder in an English country manor.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> isn’t just Agatha Christie’s first Poirot novel, it was the only Poirot novel in the public domain until 2019. It was written on a bet that Christie couldn’t write a detective novel in which the reader couldn’t deduce the criminal. Her attempt laid the foundation for one of literature’s most famous detectives.</p>
			<p>In this novel we’re introduced to Poirot as he’s settling in to a new life in England. After a woman is murdered at the country estate he’s visiting, he has to use his detective skills to catch the criminal. <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> sets the stage for the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, and has everything you’d expect from a story rich in those classic detective fiction tropes.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of 1920s London socialites struggle with their futures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Theodore Gumbrill Junior is fed up with his job as a teacher, and tries a new tack as an inventor of pneumatic trousers. The development and marketing of these is set against his attempts to find love, and the backdrop of his friends’ and acquaintances’ similar quest for meaning in what seems to them a meaningless world.</p>
			<p>Aldous Huxley, although primarily known these days for his seminal work <i>Brave New World</i>, gained fame in the 1920s as a writer of social satires such as this, his second novel. Condemned at the time for its frank treatment of sexuality and adultery⁠—it was even banned in Australia⁠—the book’s characters’ comic lack of stability following the society-wide alignment of the Great War still resonate today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Russian officer battles disillusionment and unrequited love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the young age of twenty-two Sublieutenant Romashov has become an officer, but he’s already disillusioned with army life in the middle of nowhere, and the brutish and blood-thirsty natures of his commanders and peers. The only thing keeping him from outright depression is his growing infatuation with the wife of a fellow officer; an infatuation which, half-returned, leads inevitably towards the titular subject.</p>
			<p><i>The Duel</i> is regarded as the highlight of Kuprin’s bibliography and was praised by famous Russian authors of the period including Chekhov, Gorky, Bunin and Tolstoy. It was published in 1905 in the middle of the failure of the Russian army in the Russo-Japanese war and widespread social unrest. Kuprin himself had military experience as a lieutenant, which shines through in the novel’s vivid depictions of the minutiae of officer life. <i>The Duel</i> was later adapted for both film and television in Russia. This edition is based on the 1916 translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A jaded Russian fop’s disdain for the world catches up with him.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Eugene Onegin is bored: bored of the city, of parties, and of the superficial St. Petersburg social scene. So when a newly-deceased uncle leaves him his country mansion, he jumps at the chance to play the rural lord. There he meets his new neighbours Lenski, a young poet and stark contrast to Onegin’s affected nonchalance, and Tattiana, a dreamy but introverted romantic, and triggers a set of events with tragic consequences.</p>
			<p>Serialized over the course of seven years starting in 1825, Pushkin’s novel in verse was and is a huge influence on Russian literature. Its unusual verse structure combined with Pushkin’s own commentary on the social canvas of the time has meant that it has remained relevant and read to this day. <i>Eugene Onegine</i> has been translated into many different languages, and into many different formats including successful operas and films.</p>

		<summary type="text">An unjustly imprisoned man longs after both his love and his tulips.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After the conviction of two prominent politicians for sedition, Dumas’s story focuses on the trial of an accused collaborator: one Cornelius van Baerle, whose only wish is to grow his tulips in peace. His crowning achievement is set to be the impossible black tulip, a feat worth one hundred thousand guilders from the Horticultural Society of Haarlem, but before he can sprout the bulb he’s imprisoned with only the daughter of the prison warden to give him a glimmer of hope.</p>
			<p>Set a few decades after the tulip mania of the 1630, Alexandre Dumas’s novel opens with a historical incident: the mob killing of Johan and Cornelius de Witt, then high up in the government. Dumas successfully balances the romance of the protagonist’s love for both the heroine and his precious tulip, with a quest to prove his innocence and thwart the schemes of his rival tulip-fancier Boxtel. <i>The Black Tulip</i> was originally published in three volumes in French in 1850; presented here is the 1902 translation by publisher <abbr>P. F.</abbr> Collier &amp; Son.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Gascon moves to Paris to join the King’s Musketeers where he starts to investigate the kidnapping of his landlord’s wife.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Three Musketeers</i> is the first of three adventure novels written by Alexandre Dumas featuring the character of d’Artagnan.</p>
			<p>The young d’Artagnan leaves home in Gascony for Paris to join the King’s Musketeers. On his way to Paris, the letter which will introduce him to the commander of the Musketeers is stolen by a mysterious man in the town of Meung. This “Man of Meung” turns out to be a confidente of the infamous Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of the government of France.</p>
			<p>When he arrives in Paris and seeks an audience with the commander of the Musketeers, d’Artagnan sees this man again and rushes to confront him. As he pushes his way out he provokes three inseparable musketeers Athos, Porthos and Aramis; and ends up setting up duels with all three of them that afternoon. At the first of the duels he discovers, to his surprise, that each of the three is a second to the other. As they start to fight, they are ambushed by the Cardinal’s men and join forces. So begins one of the most enduring partnerships in literature.</p>
			<p>When d’Artagnan’s landlord tells him that his wife has been kidnapped, d’Artagnan investigates, falls in love and becomes embroiled in a plot to destabilize France.</p>
			<p><i>The Three Musketeers</i> was first published in 1844 and has been adapted for stage, film, television, and animation many times; such is the endurance of its appeal. At its heart is a fast-paced tale of love and adventure.</p>

		<summary type="text">Twelve poems detailing the adventures of Arthur’s round table.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Idylls</i> are a series of twelve long blank verse poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, telling the tale of Arthur and his round table. While some of them are stories of adventure and daring of the kind you’d expect from an Arthurian epic, many take on a darker tone, relating how Arthur was betrayed and how his kingdom grew decadent and eventually fell.</p>
			<p>The poems stand on their own as carefully-constructed and masterful examples of long-form blank-verse poetry, and they’re engaging to read strictly as tales of knighthood and intrigue—but many also read the <i>Idylls</i> as allegorical references to Victorian societal mores.</p>

			<p>After an unusual mission trading catnip to the catlike Salariki of planet Sargol, Dane Thorson and other low-ranking crew members of the <i>Solar Queen</i> watch in horror as the rest of their crew falls mysteriously ill. Only the four men left standing—and maybe the Captain’s bizarre pet Hoobat—can save their ship from drifting through space for all time, condemned as a plague ship.</p>
			<p>Originally published by Gnome Press in 1956 under the name Andrew North, <i>Plague Ship</i> is the second installment in the <i>Solar Queen</i> series of science fiction novels by Andre Norton, the male pseudonym of Alice Mary Norton.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two human protagonists find themselves on opposite sides of an inter-species war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This sequel to <i>The Stars Are Ours!</i> was first published in 1957 by the World Publishing Company. It continues the tale of the humans who escaped an anti-intellectual Earth and founded a colony on Astra, a planet across the galaxy. Astra has a vibrant, intelligent species, as well as the ruins of a much older civilization.</p>
			<p>Norton weaves two stories together by alternating points of view with each chapter. We follow a 4th generation colonist, as well as a mechanic-pilot newly arrived on Astra as a member of a research mission from a recently revived Earth.</p>
			<p>Each is on a journey of discovery, and they find themselves allied with opposing sides of an ongoing war between two intelligent, indigenous species.</p>

		<summary type="text">A schoolgirl navigates a difficult year after a new girl has inadvertently assumed her mantle.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ingred Saxon grew up in luxury in Rotherwood, a large house in southern England, and is looking forwards to moving back in after its wartime usage as a Red Cross hospital. Unfortunately for her, her family is weathering unforeseen financial troubles, and has had to let it out to a different family while they cram into their dramatically smaller bungalow. Even more unfortunately, the popular new girl at Grovebury College is the new tenant, leaving Ingred to remake previous bonds she’d taken for granted.</p>
			<p><i>A Popular Schoolgirl</i> is just one of nearly fifty “schoolgirl fiction” books written by Angela Brazil, and put together they sold over three million copies. As a boarder at a girls’ school herself in her youth, she successfully mined this rich seam of experience to the tune of two novels and several short stories a year. Her protagonists are ultimately believable young women, written in a way that exposes their hopes and fears at a time where possibilities for women were rapidly opening up.</p>

		<summary type="text">A memoir narrated by a horse whose idyllic time on an English farm prepares him for a life filled with constant change and varied circumstances.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The best-selling novel <i>Black Beauty</i> by Anna Sewell was published in 1877. The story is a first person narrative told from the perspective of the horse Black Beauty. This unique narrative perspective enables readers to empathize with the lives of working horses and to reflect upon the cruel treatment that has been inflicted upon them. As a result, the novel serves as a strenuous and timeless statement against animal cruelty and exploitation.</p>

		<summary type="text">When a mysterious young widow arrives in a small rural area, gossip blackens her name before her true story is eventually discovered by a male admirer.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was the second novel written by Anne Brontë, the youngest of the Brontë sisters. First released in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell, it was considered shocking by the standards of the time due to its themes of domestic disharmony, drunkenness and adultery. Perhaps this was why it quickly became a publishing success. However, when Anne died from tuberculosis her sister Charlotte prevented its republication until 1854, perhaps fearing for her sister’s reputation, though some attributed her actions to jealousy.</p>
			<p>The story is framed as a series of letters by the protagonist Gilbert Markham to his friend Halford. Markham tells of the arrival of a young widow, Mrs. Graham, in his rural neighborhood. She brings with her her five year old son Arthur and takes up residence in the partly-ruined Wildfell Hall. Gossip soon begins to swirl around her, questioning her mysterious background and the closeness of her relationship with her landlord Frederick Lawrence. Dismissing these concerns, Gilbert Markham becomes deeply enamored of Helen Graham, and she seems to return his affection strongly. He however becomes increasingly suspicious and jealous of Lawrence, who makes frequent visits to the Hall. He secretly espies them walking together one night, apparently in a romantic relationship. After he confronts Helen over this, she gives him her diary of the last few years and tells him to read it to understand everything. Much of the rest of the novel is made up of extracts from Helen’s diary, which tells the story of her unhappy marriage.</p>

		<summary type="text">A hero is hired to kill a monster that has been plaguing the land.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Horothgar, King of the Danes, invites warriors from neighboring kingdoms to his great mead hall with the hope that one of them will solve his problem. A monster named Grendel has been terrorizing the land and killing his people. One of the warriors who answers this call is our epic hero, Beowulf.</p>
			<p>The <i>Beowulf</i> Manuscript, also known as the Nowell Codex, dates back to the late 10th century or early 11th century and is the only copy in existence. In 1731, the manuscript was damaged from the Cotton Library fire, making several lines in the poem unreadable. Today, with the help of modern technology, advanced techniques are being used not only to preserve the document from further degradation but also to reveal missing letters. All this is done to ensure that this epic story will continue to live on for many more generations.</p>

		<summary type="text">The tale of Rudolph Rassendyll, near twin of King Rudolph V of Ruritania, who, in order to save the day, must take the king’s place after he is drugged and abducted.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> by Anthony Hope is an adventure novel first published in 1894 that takes place in the fictional Kingdom of Ruritania.</p>
			<p>It tells the story of Rudolph Rassendyll, who is, because of past indiscretions in the family and unbeknownst to him, the near twin of King Rudolph V of Ruritania. Labeled a ne’er-do-well by his sister-in-law, young Rudolph determines to escape his family and secretly travel to Ruritania for the coronation of his distant relative. But when the king is drugged and abducted on the eve of this ceremony, young Rassendyll is convinced to take his place to try and save the day.</p>
			<p>But things don’t go as planned as the conspirators fail to reckon with the king’s brother, the dastardly Duke of Strelsau or his fiance, the beautiful Princess Flavia. What follows is a tale of bravery, sacrifice and love, filled with romance and feats of derring-do that still stands the test of time.</p>
			<p><i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> was Hope’s most famous novel and achieved instant success. Such was the impact of this novel that the setting of Ruritania became famous in its own right as the generic term referring to romantic stories set in fictional central European countries. It went on to spawn numerous adaptations, retellings and homages. Anthony Hope wrote a sequel in 1898 called <i>Rupert of Hentzau</i> but it never achieved the success of the original.</p>

		<summary type="text">The affections of a young widow are at play while rival clerical factions contend for control over church matters in the cathedral city of Barchester.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Barchester Towers</i>, published in 1857, is the sequel to Trollope’s <i>The Warden</i> and continues the story of the clerical doings in the fictional cathedral town of Barchester.</p>
			<p>As this novel opens, the old Bishop of Barchester lies dying, and there is considerable doubt as to who will replace him. The Bishop’s son Dr. Grantly, the Archdeacon, has high hopes of succeeding him, but these hopes are dashed and a new Bishop, Dr. Proudie, is appointed. Along with Dr. Proudie comes his domineering wife and their ambitious chaplain the Reverend Mr. Slope.</p>
			<p>The old clerical party headed by Dr. Grantly and the new, championed by Mrs. Proudie and Mr. Slope, are soon in contention over Church matters. These two parties represent a then-significant struggle between different evangelical approaches in the Church of England. One local issue in particular is fought over—the appointment of a new Warden for Hiram’s Hospital, the focus of the preceding book.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Eleanor Bold is the daughter of Mr. Harding, the prior Warden. She has recently been widowed. The wealth she inherited from her late husband makes her an attractive match, and her affections are in contention from several prospective suitors, including the oily Mr. Slope. All of this lends itself to considerable humor and interest.</p>
			<p>Though not well received by critics on its initial publication, <i>Barchester Towers</i> is now regarded as one of Trollope’s most popular novels. Together with <i>The Warden</i>, it was made into a very successful television series by the BBC in 1982.</p>

		<summary type="text">In a cathedral town in England, a minor cleric becomes involved in a dispute about the wardenship of a hospital for superannuated wool-carders, and suffers pangs of conscience.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Warden</i> is concerned with the unassuming Rev. Septimus Harding, who has for many years been the Warden of Hiram’s Hospital in the fictional town of Barchester. This “hospital” is what we would today probably call an aged-care or retirement home. It was established under the provisions of a will to look after the needs of old men too feeble to work any longer and unable to support themselves. Mr. Harding benefits financially from his position, though the duties are very slight.</p>
			<p>A local doctor, though sweet on Mr. Harding’s daughter Eleanor, is nevertheless a keen reformer, zealous to overturn what he sees as corrupt patronage in the Church. He investigates the terms of Hiram’s will and concludes that the money intended for the benefit of the aged wool-carders is unfairly being consumed by the salary of the Warden. He proceeds to pursue this issue through the pages of a crusading journal, <i>The Jupiter</i>.</p>
			<p>Though strongly defended by the Church authorities, including his son-in-law Archdeacon Grantly, Mr. Harding has long struggles with his conscience because of this imputation.</p>
			<p><i>The Warden</i>, published in 1855, was Trollope’s first major writing success, and formed the basis for a series of six novels set in the same fictional county and its cathedral city of Barchester, now known as the “Chronicles of Barsetshire.”</p>

		<summary type="text">The rise of a business magnate with a suspicious background creates ripples among society and affects the fortunes of several young men and women in London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Way We Live Now</i> is Anthony Trollope’s longest novel, published in two volumes in 1875 after first appearing in serial form.</p>
			<p>After an extended visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1872, Trollope was outraged on his return to England by a number of financial scandals, and was determined to expose the dishonesty, corruption, and greed they embodied. <i>The Way We Live Now</i> centers around a foreign businessman, Augustus Melmotte, who has come to prominence in London despite rumors about his past dealings on the Continent. He is immensely rich, and his daughter Marie is considered to be a desirable catch for several aristocratic young men in search of a fortune. Melmotte gains substantial influence because of his wealth. He rises in society and is even put up as a candidate for Parliament, despite a general feeling that he must be a fraudster and liar. A variety of sub-plots are woven around this central idea.</p>
			<p><i>The Way We Live Now</i> is generally considered to be one of Trollope’s best novels and is often included in lists of the best novels written in English.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Chekhov’s short stories and novellas ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Anton Chekhov is widely considered to be one of the greatest short story writers in history. A physician by day, he’s famously quoted as saying, “Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress.” Chekhov wrote nearly 300 short stories in his long writing career; while at first he wrote mainly to make a profit, as his interest in writing—and his skill—grew, he wrote stories that heavily influenced the modern development of the form.</p>
			<p>His stories are famous for, among other things, their ambiguous morality and their often inconclusive nature. Chekhov was a firm believer that the role of the artist was to correctly pose a question, but not necessarily to answer it.</p>
			<p>This collection contains all of his short stories and two novellas, all translated by Constance Garnett, and arranged by the date they were originally published.</p>

			<p><i>The Duel</i> is one of Chekhov’s longest works, skirting the edge between novel and novella. Like many of Chekhov’s works, it was first published as a serial.</p>
			<p>Laevsky is a womanizing drunkard, a slave to life’s vices. His wantonness clashes with the moralistic zoologist Von Koren, who grows to despise Laevsky. Their mutual enmity culminates in a duel—though neither they, nor their friends, really want it to happen.</p>

		<summary type="text">The travelogue of a member of Robert Scott’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition of 1910.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1910 famous explorer Robert Falcon Scott led the Terra Nova Expedition to the South Pole. The expedition was part scientific and part adventure: Scott wanted to be the first to reach the pole.</p>
			<p>The expedition was beset by hardship from the beginning, and after realizing that they had been beaten to the pole by Roald Amundsen’s Norwegian Expedition, the party suffered a final tragedy: the loss of Scott and his companions to the Antarctic cold on their return journey to base camp.</p>
			<p><i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> is an autobiographical account of one of the survivors of the expedition, Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It’s a unique combination of fascinating scientific documentary, adventure novel, and with the inclusion of Scott’s final journal entries, horror story. <i>Journey</i> is peppered throughout with journal entries, illustrations, and pictures from Cherry-Garrard’s companions, making it a fascinating window into the majesty and danger of the Antarctic.</p>

		<summary type="text">Aristotle examines how one may live in the most thriving, excellent manner.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Aristotle examines how best to live by looking at the nature of those virtues that characterize the most thriving human beings, and then at how to acquire and develop such virtues. This book is considered the founding document of what is now known as the “virtue ethics” tradition.</p>
			<p>Along the way, Aristotle delves into pleasure, happiness, justice, friendship, and willpower. He intended the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> to be the foundation on which to build his <i>Politics</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> is based on Aristotle’s lectures at the Lyceum and was originally collected as a series of ten scrolls. In translation it was hugely influential in the development of Western philosophic tradition, quickly becoming one of the core works of medieval philosophy.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Theodore Racksole—one of the richest men in America, and consequently the world—sits down in London’s Grand Babylon Hotel and orders a beefsteak and a bottle of beer, he isn’t aware that he’s about to become part of a plot involving blackmail, espionage, murder, the royal families of Europe and his daughter Nella. As he’s sucked in to the inner workings of the hotel and its staff he has to make a series of stark choices for the safety of his family and guests.</p>
			<p><i>The Grand Babylon Hotel</i> proceeds at a pace that betrays the novel’s roots: it was originally serialized in 1901 in the <i>Golden Penny</i>. It was Arnold Bennett’s second novel, and was followed by at least forty works of fiction along with numerous plays and non-fiction works. Since its original publication <i>The Grand Babylon Hotel</i> has remained in print, and it has also been adapted for film and radio.</p>

		<summary type="text">The self-declared world’s first consulting detective unravels a mysterious case of murder and revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Study in Scarlet</i> is the novel which first introduced Arthur Conan Doyles’ iconic characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. It was published in 1887, initially in a popular magazine, <i>Beeton’s Christmas Annual</i>. It apparently attracted little public attention at the time, but interest in Holmes continued to build with the subsequent long series of short stories Doyle wrote featuring the austere, analytical detective, who is now one of the most well-known characters in all of English literature.</p>
			<p><i>A Study in Scarlet</i> is told from the point of view of Dr. John Watson, a medical doctor who has recently returned to London after suffering serious injury and illness as part of the Army Medical Department deployed to Afghanistan. In precarious health and even more precarious financial straits, he is looking for cheap lodgings when a friend introduces him to Sherlock Holmes. The pair agree to share the rent of a flat Holmes has found.</p>
			<p>Watson is baffled by the strange nature of his companion; his peculiar interests; his unusual breadth of knowledge in certain fields together with his unusual ignorance in others; the many strange vistors he has in the flat. Only eventually does Watson discover that Holmes has set himself up as the world’s first “consulting detective.” It’s not long before Watson finds himself assisting Holmes in a mysterious case. The body of a man has been found in an abandoned house. No marks of injury or wounds are on the body. But on the wall, scrawled in blood, is the word RACHE. The subsequent unravelling of the mystery takes many unexpected turns.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective and his faithful biographer tackle more mysterious cases.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes</i> is the fourth collection of Sherlock Holmes stories published by Arthur Conan Doyle. It begins with a preface by Dr. John Watson, supposedly written in 1917, assuring the reader that Holmes is still alive but living in quiet retirement in Sussex.</p>
			<p>This collection contains the well-known stories “The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans,” in which Holmes has to track down stolen plans for a new kind of submarine; and “The Adventure of the Devil’s Foot” in which a Cornish family is found one morning driven mad or dead, with expressions of horror on their faces. The titular story “His Last Bow” is set on the very eve of the outbreak of the First World War, and involves Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to defeat a German spy.</p>

		<summary type="text">A famous detective investigates a mysterious and apparently supernatural threat to the heir of a wealthy Dartmoor estate.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>It would be hard to nominate a more well-known character in English literature than that of the austere analytical detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1880s. Holmes, alongside his friend and biographer Dr. John Watson, appeared in two initial novels and dozens of short stories serialised in popular magazines, attracting a devoted, almost fanatical following which continues to this day.</p>
			<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, serialised in 1901–1902, was the third novel featuring Holmes and Watson. Sherlock Holmes is consulted in his Baker Street apartment by a Dr. Mortimer, a physician now living on the fringes of Dartmoor. He gives Holmes and Watson an account of a centuries-old legend. The story tells of a hell-hound which slaughtered the debauched heir of the Baskerville family who had been in lecherous pursuit of an innocent maiden across the moor. The same hound is reputed to have harrowed several of the subsequent heirs to the estate.</p>
			<p>This ancient story might be dismissed as mere fancy, but for the fact that the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville recently died in very mysterious circumstances, apparently fleeing in terror from something which came from the moor. Dr. Mortimer is concerned that the new heir, Sir Henry, just returned from Canada, may be at risk from this supernatural beast. Holmes is intrigued, but being too busy to go himself, sends Dr. Watson to accompany Sir Henry to the ancestral home on Dartmoor and to report anything suspicious.</p>
			<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> is arguably the best and most certainly the most popular of Doyle’s novels featuring his iconic detective. It has been translated into almost every language in the world and been the basis of dozens of movies (starting as early as 1914), radio plays and comic-book versions.</p>

			<p>Even though Doyle is most famous for his Sherlock stories, he was also a prolific novelist, and <i>The Lost World</i> is one of his more famous non-Sherlock novels. Like many novels of the day, it was first published serially.</p>
			<p>In it we meet a group of adventurers who head to a deep South American jungle to explore rumors of long-lost dinosaurs. The plot is driven by their journey, discoveries, and subsequent narrow escape. Notably, <i>The Lost World</i> is the novel in which Doyle’s popular recurring character, Professor Challenger, is introduced.</p>
			<p>Doyle based many of the characters and locations on people and places he was familiar with: the journalist Ed Malone was modeled on E. D. Morel, and Lord John Roxton on Roger Casement; the Lost World itself was based on descriptions of Bolivia in letters sent to Doyle by his friend Percy Harrison Fawcett.</p>
			<p>The novel remains hugely influential and widely adapted today. The title might even remind modern readers of a certain very famous movie franchise about dinosaur theme parks!</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective and his companion investigate further crimes and mysteries, culminating in a life-or-death struggle with an evil nemesis.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>, published in 1894, is the second collection of Sherlock Holmes stories published in book form. All of the stories included in the collection previously appeared in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> between 1892 and 1893. They purport to be the accounts given by Dr. John Watson of the more remarkable cases in which his friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes becomes involved in his role as a consulting detective.</p>
			<p>This collection has several memorable features. The first British edition omitted the story “The Adventure of the Cardboard Box” which appeared in <i>The Strand</i> in 1893. This story did appear in the very first American edition of the collection, immediately following “Silver Blaze,” but it was quickly replaced by a revised edition which omitted it. Apparently these omissions were at the specific request of the author, who was concerned that its inclusion of the theme of adultery would make it unsuitable for younger readers. The story was, however, eventually included in the later collection <i>His Last Bow</i>, but it is out of chronological position there. In this Standard Ebooks edition (as in most modern British editions), we have included this story to restore it to its correct chronological place in the Holmes canon.</p>
			<p><i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> is also notable because by this time Doyle had tired of the Holmes character and decided to kill him off, so that this was intended to be the last Holmes collection ever to be published. It contains several of the best-known Holmes stories, including “Silver Blaze,” “The Musgrave Ritual,” and “The Greek Interpreter,” which introduces Sherlock’s brother Mycroft; and of course “The Final Problem” in which Holmes struggles with his nemesis Professor Moriarty.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective returns to London after having faked his death some years before, and investigates a series of baffling mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> is the third collection of Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, published in 1905. It includes stories published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> in 1903 and 1904, bringing Holmes for the first time into the twentieth century.</p>
			<p>Doyle had memorably “killed off” Holmes in a struggle with his nemesis Professor Moriarty in the story “The Final Problem,” which had appeared in 1893 (and which is included in the collection <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-memoirs-of-sherlock-holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</a></i>). Intense public demand for more Holmes material after that had led to Doyle writing the novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-hound-of-the-baskervilles">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a></i>, and then finally to return to writing Holmes short stories once more. The first story in this collection, “The Adventure of the Empty House” finds Dr. Watson united once again with his old friend Sherlock Holmes, who explains how and why he faked his death at Reichenbach Falls.</p>
			<p>Apart from the leading story which “resurrects” Holmes, this collection contains a number of the best-known Holmes stories. “The Adventure of the Dancing Men” has Holmes deciphering a cryptogram to solve a mystery; encountering a callous blackmailer in “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton;” working out why cheap busts of Napoleon are being shattered all over London; and possibly averting a major European war in “The Adventure of the Second Stain.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An analytical detective is consulted by a young woman who has received a strange communication regarding her long-missing father and a mysterious treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Sign of the Four</i>, initially titled just <i>The Sign of Four</i>, is the second of Doyle’s novels to feature the analytical detective Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion and chronicler Dr. Watson. The action takes place not long after the events in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, the first Holmes novel, and that prior case is referred to frequently at the beginning of this one.</p>
			<p>Holmes is consulted by a young woman about a strange communication she has received. Ten years previously her father Captain Morstan went missing the night after returning from service in the Far East before his daughter could travel to meet him. He has never been seen or heard of ever since. But a few years after his disappearance, Miss Morstan was startled to receive a precious pearl in the mail, with no sender’s name or address and no accompanying message. A similar pearl has arrived each subsequent year. Finally, she received an anonymous letter begging her to come to a meeting outside a London theater that very evening. She may bring two companions. Naturally, Holmes and Watson accompany the young woman to the mysterious meeting, and are subsequently involved in the unveiling of a complex story of treasure and betrayal.</p>

		<summary type="text">The final novel in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes series follows the eponymous hero as he investigates a Sussex murder seemingly connected with a secret society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Valley of Fear</i> was the final novel in the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The story originally appeared over several issues of the monthly <i>Strand Magazine</i> in late 1914 before being published as a standalone novel. While Doyle would continue to publish Sherlock Holmes short stories until 1927, <i>The Valley of Fear</i> remains Holmes’ final novel appearance.</p>
			<p>In the first half of the novel, Holmes and his assistant Watson are called to assist with an investigation into the murder of John Douglas, a man apparently shot in his own home at point-blank range with a shotgun. The blast leaves little trace of a skull with which to identify him. As evidence is examined and witnesses within the house are questioned, Holmes uncovers holes in testimonies and a connection to a secret society that no one wishes to discuss.</p>
			<p>The second half of the novel elucidates the back-story of the apparent murder victim, Douglas. Years prior, Douglas had been in Chicago, on the run from the law. Wandering under the name John McMurdo, Douglas identifies himself to the local chapter of the Eminent Order of Freemen as a member from another region. The group is known by the locals as “the Scowrers,” who terrorize and extort the townspeople like a mafia under the ruthless Councilor McGinty. McMurdo, no stranger to violence, joins the employ of the Scowrers and participates in an assault on a local newspaper editor. While McMurdo tries to elevate his status within the local order, other members begin to wonder if the group’s actions are getting too brazenly violent, lest they force the intervention of government officials beyond the reach of their bribery. Douglas’ character draws inspiration from the real-life story of James McParland, an American private detective and Pinkerton agent.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of nine short fiction works by influentual supernatural and horror author Arthur Machen.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arthur Machen was a Welsh man of letters who wrote his most famous work in the late 1890s and early 1900s. While his body of work is wide, he’s perhaps best known for his supernaturally-flavored proto-horror short stories. <i>The Great God Pan</i>—perhaps his most famous work—along with “The Inmost Light” and <i>The White People</i> deeply influenced later writers like H. P. Lovecraft. Stephen King has gone so far as to call <i>The Great God Pan</i> “maybe the best [horror story] in the English language.”</p>
			<p>Besides his horror short stories, Machen also wrote a handful of post World War I supernatural shorts. One of these, “The Bowmen,” was published in a popular newspaper and was implied to be non-fiction, leading to the creation of the “Angels of Mons” urban legend. This collection includes several other World War I short stories published by Machen.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man’s visions lead him into the life of an author.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>An ancient Roman hilltop fort proves an irresistible draw to Lucian Taylor, but what awaits at the top isn’t just a view of the surrounding Welsh landscape but a bacchal experience his young soul isn’t ready for. This experience sets his path as he attempts to transcribe his increasingly elaborate visions into the perfect book; the book that will actually mean something more than the banal novels he sees the publishing houses push out.</p>
			<p><i>The Hill of Dreams</i> is a semi-autobiographical work, with Arthur Machen following a similar physical journey to the novel: a childhood in rural Wales followed by attempts to become an author in London. Machen was inspired by a review of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> that described it as “a picaresque of the mind,” and determined to write “a <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> of the soul.” The protagonist’s isolation from the rest of society certainly resonates with that description.</p>
			<p>Machen wrote this ten years earlier than its original 1907 publication, it having been turned down by the publishers of the time. While it was mostly ignored on its initial release, it has picked up admirers over the years and is now viewed as one of Machen’s most important works.</p>

		<summary type="text">A gentleman remarries a woman of questionable character and tries to redeem her, but her past revisits the family in unexpected and tragic ways.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arthur Pinero wrote <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> in 1893 after penning several successful farces. Playing on the “woman with a past” plot that was popular in melodramas, Pinero steered it in a more serious direction, centering the play around the social consequences arising when Aubrey Tanqueray remarries in an attempt to redeem a woman with a questionable past.</p>
			<p>The play’s structure is based on the principles of the “well-made play” popular throughout the 19-century. But just as Wilde manipulated the conventions of the “well-made play” to produce a new form of comedy, so did Arthur Pinero manipulate it, forgoing the happy ending to produce an elevated form of tragedy.</p>
			<p><i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> was first performed in 1893, at the St. James Theatre, London, at a time when England was still resisting the growing movement in Europe towards realism and the portrayal of real social problems and human misconduct. But while it was regarded as shocking, it ran well and made a substantial profit. Theatre historian J. P. Wearing phrased it thus: “although not as avant-garde as Ibsen’s plays, Tanqueray confronted its fashionable St. James’s audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A writer succumbing to mania tries to find a path out through occultism and religion, in Strindberg’s semi-autobiographical novel.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The narrator of <i>The Inferno</i>⁠—ostensibly August Strindberg himself⁠—has not had an easy recent past, and a move to Paris is not helping. As his mania overtakes his ability to function in the society of artists, writers, scientists and philosophers he’d like to be part of, he turns to more unconventional methods to help make sense of his world.</p>
			<p>Written in diary form, <i>The Inferno</i> is a semi-autobiographical work that blends self-deprecating humour with a whirl of neurosis and attempted rationalisation. The novel, with a certain amount of exaggeration for literary effect, charts two years of Strindberg’s life in the 1890s. Presented here is Claud Field’s 1913 translation from the original French.</p>

		<summary type="text">A civil servant tired of bureaucracy quits his job to become a writer, and falls in with a group of artists and philosophers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>August Strindberg’s novel <i>The Red Room</i> centers on the civil servant Arvid Falk as he tries to find meaning in his life through the pursuit of writing. He’s accompanied by a crew of painters, sculptors and philosophers each on their own journey for the truth, who meet in the “Red Room” of a local restaurant.</p>
			<p>Drawing heavily on August’s own experiences, The Red Room was published in Sweden in 1879. Its reception was less than complimentary in Sweden—a major newspaper called it “dirt”—but it fared better in the rest of Scandinavia and soon was recognised in his home country. Since then it has been translated into multiple languages, including the 1913 English translation by Ellise Schleussner presented here.</p>

		<summary type="text">A brief overview of the goals and methods of the Positivist philosophical movement.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Auguste Comte, considered by some to be the first “philosopher of science,” was perhaps most famous for founding the theory of Positivism: a framework of thinking and living meant to engender unity across humanity, backed by love, science, and intellect.</p>
			<p>Positivism itself is a combination philosophy and way of life. Here Comte lays down the various tenents of the philosophy, describing what he views as the six major characteristics of the system. Comte goes into surprising detail, going so far as to describe minutae like how children should be educated, the structure of a unified global committee of nations, new flags, calendars, the role of the arts, and so on. He ends the book with what he calls the “Religion of Humanity,” a secular religion meant to replace the traditional religions that people of the time were becoming disillusioned with.</p>
			<p>The book and the theory are both very much products of the time. Comte was born around the end of the French Revolution, and lived in Paris during that time when republican ideas, respect for science, and a revolutionary and forward-thinking spirit made fertile ground for change. He viewed Positivism as the single solution to most of the problems of the day, including Communism, the plight of the working class, the shift away from traditional religion, and the constant war and strife that had plagued humanity.</p>
			<p>Comte’s theories gained a huge following: you might even recognize the Positivist motto, “Order and Progress,” inscribed on Brazil’s national flag. While Positivism and its executive arm, the Church of Humanity, today only seem to survive in any significant number in Brazil—and even there in a greatly declined state—its theories were hugely influential in the emergence of many “ethical societies” and secular church movements around the globe.</p>

		<summary type="text">A daring Englishman with a secret identity rescues French aristocrats from the guillotine during the French Revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the height of the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror, a mysterious daredevil rescues French aristocrats from execution and smuggles them out of France. This secretive escape artist is known to the French authorities only by the drawings of a flower, the scarlet pimpernel, that he leaves as his calling card.</p>
			<p>Marguerite St. Just has avoided the worst of the revolutionary turmoil. Her recent marriage to the English baronet Sir Percy Blakeney has taken her away from the chaos in France to England, where she is quickly recognized as the most fashionable and clever lady in London. But even in England, she is unable to escape the effects of the Revolution, and she is soon blackmailed into a plot to unmask and capture the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>
			<p>With <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, Baroness Orczy introduced the world to a talented, adventurous hero hiding behind a dull and ineffectual secret identity. Countless imitators followed, until the “secret identity” became a common feature of adventure stories.</p>
			<p>In addition to the novel, Orczy wrote with her husband a stage play of the same name, which broke stage records and saw several revivals. Both the play and the novel received much critical and popular acclaim, and Orczy went on to write several sequels about the mysterious Pimpernel and his companions.</p>

		<summary type="text">A rollicking Elizabethan comedy in which two con men and their female compatriot gull a series of unfortunate victims out of their money.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>First performed in 1610, <i>The Alchemist</i> is one of Ben Jonson’s greatest comedies. Written for the King’s Men—the acting company to which Shakespeare belonged—it was first performed in Oxford because the playhouses in London were closed due to the plague. It was an immediate success and has remained a popular staple ever since.</p>
			<p>The play centers around a con man, his female accomplice, and a roguish butler who uses his master’s house to gull a series of victims out of their money and goods. Jonson uses the play to satirize as many people as he can—pompous lords, greedy commoners, and self-righteous Anabaptists alike—as his three con artists proceed to bilk everyone who comes to their door. They don multiple roles and weave elaborate tales to exploit their victim’s greed and amass a small fortune. But it all comes to a sudden, raucous end when the master unexpectedly returns to London and all the victims gather to try and reclaim their property.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young nobleman is moved by the condition of the poor in England, and falls in love with a labourer’s daughter.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Benjamin Disraeli was a remarkable historical figure. Born into a Jewish family, he converted to Anglican Christianity as a child. He is now almost certainly most famous for his political career. Becoming a member of the British Parliament at the age of 33, he initially rose to prominence within the Conservative (“Tory”) party because of his clashes with the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. Rising to lead the Conservative Party, Disraeli became Prime Minister for a short period in 1868, and then for an extended period between 1874 and 1880. He became friendly with Queen Victoria and was appointed Earl of Beaconsfield by her in 1876.</p>
			<p>However, Disraeli was much more than a politician. He wrote both political treatises and no less than seventeen novels during his lifetime, of which <i>Sybil, or The Two Nations</i> is now among the best regarded. The “Two Nations” of the subtitle refer to the divisions in Britain between the rich and the poor, each of whom might as well be living in a different country from the other. In the novel, Disraeli highlights the terrible living conditions of the poor and the shocking injustices of how they were treated by most employers and land-owners. He contrasts this with the frivolous, pampered livestyles of the aristocracy. He covers the rise of the Chartist movement, which was demanding universal manhood suffrage—the right for all adult men to vote, regardless of whether they owned property—and other reforms to enable working men a voice in the government of the country. (Female suffrage was to come much later). The upheavals of the time led to the development of the People’s Charter and a massive petition with millions of signatures being presented to Parliament. However the Parliament of the time refused to even consider the petition, triggering violent protests in Birmingham and elsewhere. All of this is well covered and explained in the novel.</p>
			<p><i>Sybil</i> is rather disjointed in structure as it ranges over these different topics, but the main plot revolves around Egremont, the younger son of a nobleman, who encounters some of the leaders of the workers’ movement and in particular Walter Gerard, one of the most respected of these leaders, whom Egremont befriends while concealing his real name and social position. During visits to Gerard under an assumed name, Egremont falls for the beautiful and saintly Sybil, Gerard’s daughter, but she rejects him when his true identity is exposed. Sybil subsequently undergoes many difficult trials as the people’s movement develops and comes into conflict with the authorities.</p>

		<summary type="text">Benjamin Franklin writes about his youth, adventures, and achievements.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Benjamin Franklin is a man who needs little introduction. He wore many hats over the course of his fascinating life, from that of a printer, to an inventor, to a scientist, to a politician, a founding father and statesman, and even a postmaster-general. He was famous for all of these things in his day, but he was also famed for his keen insight into people and human nature, and his sparkling talent as a conversationalist.</p>
			<p>Despite his accomplishments, Franklin seemed to keep a down-to-earth demeanor, favoring home-spun sayings and simple, direct, honest prose—the kind of prose that shines in this autobiography.</p>
			<p>The autobiography itself has a long and complex publication history. Franklin composed it in fits and spurts between 1771 and 1790, and never had a chance to complete it, let alone publish it, in his lifetime. It was first published as a poor French translation of an unrevised edition of the manuscript, and then as a heavily-editorialized and inaccurate English edition by Franklin’s son, William Temple Franklin. In 1868 John Bigelow purchased the original copy of the autobiography and published the first accurate edition, which is what subsequent publications, including this one, are based on.</p>
			<p>Though incomplete, this autobiography is a highly readable and fascinating insight into the legendary life of the man some people call the “First American.”</p>

			<p><i>The Problems of Philosophy</i>, published in 1912, is an introductory book for a beginner in philosophical studies. In this book, the author attempts to provoke a discussion by posing different problems.</p>
			<p>The book covers a wide variety of theories proposed by philosophers like Plato, Descartes, Hume, Aristotle, etc. In view of these theories, Russell poses questions about the nature of reality and our perception of it.</p>
			<p>While the book refrains from providing absolute solutions to the problems it describes, it excels in guiding the readers towards developing their own way of thinking.</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiography of Booker T. Washington, former slave and founder of the Tuskegee Institute.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Booker Taliaferro Washington began life as a slave in Virginia shortly before emancipation, but rose to become one of the most celebrated leaders the African American community has ever had. His principal occupation was as president of the Tuskegee Institute, which he founded in 1881, but he earned national renown as an orator, writer and political advisor. His address at the Atlanta Exposition was a pivotal moment in race relations in America.</p>
			<p>Washington believed deeply in the dignity of physical labor, and that merit and talent is eventually rewarded regardless of race or class. The Tuskegee Institution was primarily a technical college, and aimed to teach industrial skills in addition to academic training. Students built many of the buildings on the campus, grew the food that was eaten there, and even made the furniture, tools and vehicles used by the school.</p>
			<p><i>Up from Slavery</i> was originally published as a serialized work in <i>The Outlook</i>, a Christian magazine based in New York, before being collected in a single volume in 1901. This edition includes an introduction by Walter H. Page, a future US ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>

		<summary type="text">The scion of an old-money Midwestern family must cope with their waning fortunes and the changes brought on by industry and the automobile age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, winner of the 1919 Pulitzer prize, is considered by many to be Booth Tarkington’s finest novel and an American classic. The story is set in the Midwest, where George, the spoiled and oblivious scion of an old-money family, must cope with their waning fortunes and the rise of industry barons in the automobile age.</p>
			<p>George’s antiheroic struggles with modernity encapsulate a greater theme of change and renewal—specifically, the very American notion of a small community exploding into a dark and dirty city virtually overnight by virtue of industrial “progress.” Tarkington’s nuanced portrayal of the often-unlikable Amberson family and his paradoxical framing of progress as a destroyer of family, community, and environment, make <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> a fascinating and forward-thinking novel—certainly one with a permanent place in the American social canon. Despite the often heavy themes, Tarkington’s prose remains uniquely witty, charming, and brisk.</p>
			<p>The novel is the second in Tarkington’s “Growth” trilogy of novels, and has been adapted several times for radio, film, and television, including a 1942 Orson Welles adaptation that many consider one of the finest American films ever made.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the most famous public-domain horror novels in existence, responsible for not just introducing the eponymous Count Dracula, but for introducing many of the common tropes we see in modern horror fiction.</p>
			<p>Count Dracula isn’t the first vampire to have graced the pages of literature—that honor is thought to belong to Lord Ruthven in <i>The Vampyr</i>, by John William Polidori—but Dracula is the vampire on which modern vampires are based.</p>
			<p><i>Dracula</i> wasn’t as famous in its day as it is today; readers of the time seemed to enjoy it as nothing more than a good story, and Stoker died nearly penniless. But its long-lasting influence is undeniable, and for all its age <i>Dracula</i> remains a gripping, fast-paced, and enjoyable read.</p>

		<summary type="text">A swashbuckling adventure on the fabled continent of Atlantis.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Lost Continent</i>, initially published as a serial in 1899, remains one of the enduring classics of the “lost race” genre. In it we follow Deucalion, a warrior-priest on the lost continent of Atlantis, as he tries to battle the influence of an egotistical upstart empress. Featuring magic, intrigue, mythical monsters, and fearsome combat on both land and sea, the story is nothing if not a swashbuckling adventure.</p>
			<p><i>The Lost Continent</i> was very influential on pulp fiction of the subsequent decades, and echoes of its style can be found in the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, and others.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comet threatens to collide with the Earth, perhaps bringing about the end of the world.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Born in 1842, Camille Flammarion was a French astronomer who wrote many popular books about science and astronomy, together with a number of novels which we would now consider to be science fiction. He was a contemporary of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, though his works never achieved their level of popularity.</p>
			<p><i>Omega: The Last Days of the World</i> is an English translation of Flammarion’s novel <i xml:lang="fr">La Fin du Monde</i>, published in 1893. The book’s fictional premise is the discovery of a comet on a collision course with the Earth in the 25th century. However, this is mostly a pretext on which Flammarion can hang his interesting scientific speculations about how the world will end, together with philosophical thoughts about war and religion. Much of the scientific description he uses in the book, while accurately representing the knowledge and thinking of his time, has today been superseded by modern discoveries. For example, we now know the source of the Sun’s energy to be nuclear fusion rather than being due to gravitational contraction and the constant infall of meteorites.</p>
			<p>When talking about the ills of society, however, Flammarion could well be talking about today’s world. For example, he excoriates the vast waste of society’s resources on war, and demonstrates how much more productive each nation’s economy would be without it. He also depicts the media of his future world as having been entirely taken over by commercial interests, publishing only what will excite the greatest number of readers rather than serving the public interest.</p>
			<p><i>Omega</i> ranges over a vast period of time, from prehistory through to millions of years in the future when mankind has been reduced to the last two doomed individuals. Nevertheless, the book ends on a hopeful and inspiring note.</p>

		<summary type="text">Young Tom Corbett finally realizes his dream of becoming a Space Cadet but soon he and his classmates find themselves fighting to stay alive in the harsh Martian desert.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Inspired by Robert A. Heinlein’s 1948 novel <i>Space Cadet</i>, the Tom Corbett series started as a TV show in 1950. It stayed on the air for five years and, among other things, spawned a series of novels published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Written by unknown authors, they were published under the pseudonym Carey Rockwell, with Willy Ley (the TV show’s technical director) listed as technical advisor.</p>
			<p><i>Stand by for Mars!</i> is the first of eight novels written between 1952 and 1956. It features a young Tom Corbett who is trying to fulfill his dream of becoming a Space Cadet on his way to joining the Solar Guard. But interpersonal conflicts stand in his way. Tom, along with his unit-mates Astro and Roger Manning must find a way past their difficulties or else risk being washed out. Their adventure takes them from the rigours of the Academy on Earth to the rugged and deadly deserts of Mars where they need to learn that only by working together can they hope to survive.</p>
			<p>An entire generation grew up on the adventures of Tom Corbett—it spawned radio shows, music recordings and a whole series of toys and tie-ins. Fans still maintain a <a href="http://www.solarguard.com/">Tom Corbett Space Cadet website</a> and have held reunions as recently as 2006. <i>Stand by for Mars!</i> is a classic example of the space-crazy juvenile fiction of its era.</p>

		<summary type="text">The eminent Victorian scientist and mathematician on his inventions, dreams and adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Charles Babbage was a Victorian polymath, and someone with a seemingly never-ending intellectual curiosity about the world around him. A mathematician by training, he also wrote copiously on subjects such as economics, physics, engineering, computation, cryptography, religion and education, along with conducting practical experiments with pretty much anything that had grabbed his interest at the time. Today, he’s widely viewed to be the father of the computer with his Difference and Analytical Engines. Although neither were fully completed during his lifetime, a working replica of the Difference Engine was built in the 1990s, and an Analytical Engine is currently in the planning stages.</p>
			<p>This autobiography (first published near the end of his life in 1864) veers from topic to topic and rarely settles on any subject for more than a chapter. Apart from his early life and an explanation of the thinking behind his computing Engines, Babbage also transcribes his memories of climbing into an active volcano, arguing with street musicians, picking locks, standing in elections, and imagining life as a cheese mite, among other diverse subjects. The original meaning of the titular word “Philosopher” is “lover of wisdom,” and this book shows Babbage to be just that.</p>

		<summary type="text">A distinguished amateur scientist lays out the evidence for the origin of species by means of natural selection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> by Charles Darwin must rank as one of the most influential and consequential books ever published, initiating scientific, social and religious ferment ever since its first publication in 1859. Its full title is <i>The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i>, in some editions prefaced by the word “On.”</p>
			<p>Darwin describes the book as simply an “abstract” of his ideas, which are more fully fleshed out and supported with detailed examples in his other, more scholarly works (for example, he wrote several long treatises entirely about barnacles). <i>The Origin of Species</i> itself was intended to reach a wider audience and is written in such a way that any reasonably educated and thoughtful reader can follow Darwin’s argument that species of animals and plants are not independent creations, fixed for all time, but mutable. Species have been shaped in response to the effects of natural selection, which Darwin compares to the directed or manual selection by human breeders of domesticated animals.</p>
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> was eagerly taken up by the reading public, and rapidly went through several editions. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the sixth edition published by John Murray in 1872, generally considered to be the definitive edition with many amendments and updates by Darwin himself.</p>
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> has never been out of print and continues to be an extremely popular work. Later scientific discoveries such as the breakthrough of DNA sequencing have refined our concept of some of Darwin’s ideas and given us a better understanding of issues he found puzzling, but the basic thrust of his theory remains unchallenged.</p>

		<summary type="text">A miserly moneylender is visited by four ghosts who help him see how to honor Christmas in his heart all year round.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Charles Dickens wrote <i>A Christmas Carol</i> in 1843 and the first edition, published on 19th December, was so successful that it sold out in just six days. The publishers had to produce two further editions between Christmas and the new year to meet the demand, and the novella has never been out of print.</p>
			<p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> tells the story of a greedy money-lender, Ebeneezer Scrooge, who is first visited by the ghost of his former business partner and then by three spirits⁠—the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. They show Scrooge’s lack of compassion to him, compelling him to act more compassionately in the future and to honor Christmas in his heart.</p>

		<summary type="text">A family is reunited, added to, and then threatened to be torn apart by events arising from the French Revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A doctor is released from the Bastille after being falsely imprisoned for almost eighteen years. A young woman discovers the father she’s never known is not dead but alive, if not entirely well. A young man is acquitted of being a traitor, due in part to the efforts of a rather selfish lout who is assisting the young man’s attorney. A man has a wine shop in Paris with a wife who knits at the bar. These disparate elements are tied together as only Dickens can, and in the process he tells the story of the French Revolution.</p>
			<p>Charles Dickens was fascinated by Thomas Carlyle’s magnum opus <i>The French Revolution</i>; according to Dickens’ letters, he read it “500 times” and carried it with him everywhere while he was working on this novel. When he wrote to Carlyle asking him for books to read on background, Carlyle sent him two cartloads full. Dickens mimicked Carlyle’s style, his chronology, and his overall characterization of the revolution; although <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is fiction, the historical events described are largely accurate, sometimes exactly so. Even so, Dickens made his name and reputation on telling stories full of characters one could be invested in, care about, and despise, and this novel has all of those and more. It also, in its first and last lines, has two of the most famous lines in literature. With the possible exception of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a>, it is his most popular novel, and according to many, his best.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman of uncertain parentage is taken in by a kindly guardian, while her fate and that of two other young people hinge on the outcome of an interminable legal case.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Bleak House</i>, completed by Dickens in 1853, tells several interlocking story-lines and features a host of colorful characters. Though very difficult to summarise, the novel centers around the decades-long legal case of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>, involving the fair distribution of assets of a valuable estate. The case is mired in the legal quagmire of the Court of Chancery, whose byzantine and sluggish workings Dickens spares no effort to expose and condemn. Dickens also exposes the miserable condition of the poor, living in squalid, pestilential circumstances.</p>
			<p>The novel’s heroine is Esther Summerson, whose parentage is unclear and who has been brought up by a cold and strict godmother, who tells her only: “Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.” On the death of her godmother, she is given an education through the unexpected intervention of a Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, whom she has never met. When she comes of age, she is appointed as a companion to Ada, one of two young people who are “wards of Chancery,” whose fates depend on the outcome of the legal struggle and who are taken into guardianship by Mr. Jarndyce. The other ward Richard, despite Mr. Jarndyce’s frequent warnings, eventually goes astray by pinning all his hopes on a successful outcome of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i></p>
			<p>We are also introduced to Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, and to their cunning and suspicious lawyer, Mr. Tulkinghorn. He uncovers evidence that Lady Dedlock is not all she seems and determines to remorselessly pursue every lead to expose her secrets.</p>
			<p>The novel has a curious construction in that the first-person narrative of Esther, written in the past tense, is interleaved with many chapters written from the omniscient viewpoint and in the present tense.</p>
			<p>Several prominent critics such as G. K. Chesterton consider <i>Bleak House</i> to be Dickens’ finest novel, and it is often ranked among the best English-language novels of all time.</p>

		<summary type="text">The semi-autobiographical tale of a young boy who rises up to become a successful novelist.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Like many of Dickens’ works, <i>David Copperfield</i> was published serially, then as a complete novel for the first time in 1850. Dickens himself thought of it as his favorite novel, writing in the preface that of all his works <i>Copperfield</i> was his favorite child. This isn’t surprising, considering that many of the events in the novel are semi-autobiographical accounts from Dickens’ own life.</p>
			<p>In <i>David Copperfield</i> we follow the life of the titular character as he makes a life for himself in England. He finds himself in the care of a cold stepfather who sends him to boarding school, and from there embarks on a journey filled with characters and events that can only be called “Dickensian” in their colorful and just-barely-probable portrayals.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wealthy man in the industrial north of England raises his children on purely rational principles, with unfortunate results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Hard Times</i> (originally <i>Hard Times—For These Times</i>) was published in 1854, and is the shortest novel Charles Dickens ever published. It’s set in Coketown, a fictional mill-town set in the north of England. One of the major themes of the book is the miserable treatment of workers in the mills, and the resistance to their unionization by the mill owners, typified by the character Josiah Bounderby, who absurdly asserts that the workers live a near-idyllic life but they all “expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon.” The truth, of course, is far different.</p>
			<p>The other major topic which Dickens tackles in this novel is the rationalist movement in schooling and the denigration of imagination and fantasy. It begins with the words “Now, what I want is, Facts,” spoken by the wealthy magnate Thomas Gradgrind, who is supervising a class at a model school he has opened. This indeed is Gradgrind’s entire philosophy. “Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.” He is supported and encouraged in this approach by his friend Bounderby. Grandgrind raises his own children on these principles, and, as we discover, in doing so blights their lives.</p>
			<p>The novel also follows the story of a particular mill-worker, Stephen Blackpool, who leads a tragic life. He is burdened with an alcoholic, slatternly wife, who is mostly absent from his life, but who returns at irregular intervals to trouble him. This existing marriage, and the near-impossibility of divorce for someone of his class, prevents him marrying Rachel, who is the light of his life. Dickens depicts Stephen as representing the nobility of honest work, and contrasts his character with that of the self-satisfied humbug Josiah Bounderby who represents the worst aspects of capitalism.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor boy, born and raised in a workhouse in Victorian England, falls into the control of a gang of heartless criminals.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Oliver Twist, or The Parish Boy’s Progress</i> was Charles Dickens’ second novel, following <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, and was published as a serial in the magazine <i>Bentley’s Miscellany</i> between 1837 and 1839. It details the misadventures of its eponymous character, Oliver Twist, born in a Victorian-era workhouse, his mother dying within minutes of his birth. He is raised in miserable conditions, half-starved, and then sent out as an apprentice to an undertaker. Running away from this situation, he walks to London and falls under the influence of a criminal gang run by an old man called Fagin, who wants to employ the child as a pickpocket.</p>
			<p>The novel graphically depicts the wretched living conditions of much of the poor people of Victorian times and the disgusting slums in which they were forced to live. It has been accused of perpetrating anti-Semitic stereotypes in the character of Fagin, almost always referred to as “the Jew” in the book’s early chapters. Interestingly, while the serial was still running in the magazine, Dickens was eventually persuaded that he was wrong in this and removed many such usages in later episodes. He also introduced more kindly Jewish characters in such later novels as <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Oliver Twist</i> was immediately popular in serial form, with its often gripping story and lurid details. It has remained one of Dicken’s best-loved novels, and the story has often been made into films and television series, as well as into a very popular musical, <i>Oliver!</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">Former slave Julius tells fantastical tales about plantation life to the incredulous Northerners who have just moved in.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Conjure Woman</i> is a collection of fantastical stories narrated by Julius, a former slave, about life on the nearby plantations prior to the Civil War. Each involves an element of magic, be it a vine that dooms those who eat from it or a man transformed into a tree to avoid being separated from his wife. Julius’s audience, a married couple who have just moved to the South to cultivate grapes, listen on with mixed sympathy and disbelief. They disagree on whether Julius is telling the truth and whether there is some deeper significance to the tales. At turns humorous and unsettling, these stories provide a surprising lens into the realities of slavery.</p>
			<p>The text is notable for spelling out Julius’s spoken accent. Although Julius has some stereotypical features of a simple-minded old slave, he is often regarded as a more clever and complicated figure. He seems to tell his tales not only to entertain his listeners, but to trick them to his advantage.</p>
			<p>Many of these stories first appeared in national magazines, where they received popular acclaim, before being assembled as their own volume in 1899. Charles W. Chesnutt’s race was not mentioned by the publisher, nor could many guess his African heritage based on his appearance. However, Chesnutt embraced his African-American identity and was a prominent activist for black rights. <i>The Conjure Woman</i>, his first book, is considered an important early work of African-American fiction.</p>
			<p>This edition includes four additional Julius tales that appeared in magazines but were not collected during Chesnutt’s lifetime.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman is hired by the mysterious master of Thornfield Hall as a governess for his young ward.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Jane Eyre experienced abuse at a young age, not only from her aunt—who raised her after both her parents died—but also from the headmaster of Lowood Institution, where she is sent away to. After ten years of living and teaching at Lowood Jane decides she is ready to see more of the world and takes a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall. Jane later meets the mysterious master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Rochester, and becomes drawn to him.</p>
			<p>Charlotte Brontë published <i>Jane Eyre: An Autobiography</i> on October 16th 1847 using the pen name “Currer Bell.” The novel is known for revolutionizing prose fiction, and is considered to be ahead of its time because of how it deals with topics of class, religion, and feminism.</p>

		<summary type="text">In the early part of the 19th Century, two young women struggle in different ways for independence and love during turbulent times caused by the advent of mechanical looms in the textile industry.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Shirley</i>, published in 1849, was Charlotte Brontë’s second novel after <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte/jane-eyre">Jane Eyre</a></i>. Published under her pseudonym of “Currer Bell,” it differs in several respects from that earlier work. It is written in the third person with an omniscient narrator, rather than the first-person of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and incorporates the themes of industrial change and the plight of unemployed workers. It also features strong pleas for the recognition of women’s intellect and right to their independence of thought and action.</p>
			<p>Set in the West Riding of Yorkshire during the Napoleonic period of the early 19th Century, the novel describes the confrontations between textile manufacturers and organized groups of workers protesting the introduction of mechanical looms. Three characters stand out: Robert Moore, a mill-owner determined to introduce modern methods despite sometimes violent opposition; his young cousin Caroline Helstone, who falls deeply in love with Robert; and Shirley Keeldar, a rich heiress who comes to live in the estate of Fieldhead, on whose land Robert’s mill stands. Robert’s business is in trouble, not so much because of the protests of the workers but because of a government decree which prevents him selling his finished cloth overseas during the duration of the war with Napoleon. He receives a loan from Miss Keeldar, and her interest in him seems to be becoming a romantic one, much to the distress of Caroline, who pines away for lack of any sign of affection from Robert.</p>
			<p>Shirley Keeldar is a remarkable female character for the time: strong, very independent-minded, dismissive of much of the standard rules of society, and determined to decide on her own future. Interestingly, up to this point, the name “Shirley” was almost entirely a male name; Shirley’s parents had hoped for a boy. Such was the success of Brontë’s novel, however, that it became increasingly popular as a female name and is now almost exclusively so.</p>
			<p>Although never as popular or successful as the more classically romantic <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Shirley</i> is nevertheless now highly regarded by critics.</p>

		<summary type="text">Dr. Faustus sells his soul to Lucifer in return for magical powers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</i>, Christopher Marlowe’s classic interpretation of the Dr. Faustus legend, was first performed in London by the Admiral’s Men around 1592. It is believed to be the first dramatization of this classic tale wherein Faustus, a German scholar, trades his soul to Lucifer in return for magical powers and the command over the demon Mephistopheles. Faustus at first seeks to expand his knowledge of the universe, but soon finds that a deal with the devil brings little satisfaction. All too soon the contract expires, and Faustus is faced with the prospect of eternal damnation.</p>
			<p>Two principal versions of this play exist, one based on the 1604 quarto (the A text) and a longer, emended version published in 1616 (the B text). This edition is based on Havelock Ellis’s 1893 edition of the 1604 text (the A text is currently believed by many scholars to be the closest to Marlowe’s original).</p>
			<p>Often considered to be Marlowe’s greatest work, <i>Doctor Faustus</i> builds on the ancestry of the medieval morality play, but brings a more sympathetic view to the straying hero than those precursors to Elizabethan drama, and even ventures to pose questions of common Christian doctrine. This is the last play written by Marlowe before he was killed in a Deptford tavern.</p>

		<summary type="text">39-year-old Helen McGill⁠—disgruntled with her life tending to her brother and his farm⁠—becomes the unlikely owner of a traveling bookseller’s wagon, and travels across the New England countryside spreading love and the joy of reading.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Parnassus on Wheels</i> is Christopher Morley’s first novel, and the first of two written from a woman’s perspective, the second being <i>The Haunted Bookshop</i>, this book’s sequel. <i>Parnassus on Wheels</i> was inspired by a novel by David Grayson (pseudonym of Ray Stannard Baker) called <i>The Friendly Road</i>, and is prefaced by a letter to Grayson from Morley. The word “Parnassus” from the title refers to “Mount Parnassus,” the home of the Muses in Greek mythology.</p>
			<p>The protagonist is 39-year-old Helen McGill, who lives on a farm owned by her brother Andrew. The book’s Parnassus is a large, horse-drawn van owned by Roger Mifflin, out of which he buys and sells books while traveling around the New England countryside. Mifflin arrives at the McGill farm, looking to sell the business to someone interested in the noble cause of spreading literature to the common man. Helen is at first turned off by Mr. Mifflin, but decides on a whim that an escape from her dreadful farm⁠—and her insufferable brother Andrew⁠—is just what she needs. She buys the Parnassus, and embarks on exactly the type of adventure she had hoped for.</p>

		<summary type="text">Cicero gives practical guidance for living wisely and well by adopting a Stoic outlook and concentrating on the virtues.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Cicero composed these discourses while in his villa in Tusculum as he was mourning the death of his daughter, in order to convey his philosophy of how to live wisely and well. They take the form of fictional dialogues between Cicero and his friends, with each one focusing on a particular Stoic theme. The first, “On the Contempt of Death,” reminds us that mortality is nothing to be upset about. The second, “On Bearing Pain,” reassures us that philosophy is a balm for pains of the body. The third and fourth, “On Grief of Mind” and “Other Perturbations of the Mind,” say that this extends also to mental anguish and unrest. The last, “Whether Virtue Alone Be Sufficient for a Happy Life,” tells us that the key to happiness is already in our hands: it is not to rely on accidents of fate, but on our own efforts in areas of life that are under our own control.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man from a working-class English coal miner’s family struggles to reconcile romantic and familial love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i>, a story of working-class England, is D. H. Lawrence’s third novel. It went through various drafts, and was titled “Paul Morel” until the final draft, before being published and met with an indifferent reaction from contemporary critics. Modern critics now consider it to be D. H. Lawrence’s masterpiece, with the Modern Library placing it ninth in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.”</p>
			<p>The novel follows the Morels, a family living in a coal town, and headed by a passionate but boorish miner. His wife, originally from a refined family, is dragged down by Morel’s classlessness, and finds her life’s joy in her children. As the children grow up and start leading lives of their own, they struggle against their mother’s emotional drain on them.</p>
			<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was written during a period in Lawrence’s life when his own mother was gravely ill. Its exploration of the Oedipal instinct, frank depiction of working-class household unhappiness and violence, and accurate and colorful depiction of Nottinghamshire dialect, make it a fascinating window into the life of people not often chronicled in fiction of the day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A nine-year-old girl’s humorous depiction of high society, exactly as written in her notebook.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Daisy Ashford was just nine years old when she penned (or rather, penciled) <i>The Young Visiters</i> in her notebook. As an adult, she found the manuscript along with other childhood writings and showed them to her literary friends for a laugh. They were so delighted that they passed them around their circle. The unexpected result was a publishing deal, with J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, writing the preface. So clever was the book that some assumed Barrie himself had written the entire thing as an elaborate hoax.</p>
			<p>The story’s “hero” is Alfred Salteena, a polite but bumbling man who hopes to learn the ways of the elite. He is in love with a younger woman, Ethel, but a love triangle with his friend Bernard soon emerges. The characters attend “sumshious” balls, stay in lavish “compartments,” and wear elaborate “get ups,” all of it rendered in Ashford’s original childish spelling. The story reads like a pastiche of high society and even a parody of the Victorian novel.</p>
			<p><i>The Young Visiters</i> was published in 1919 and was reprinted eighteen times in that year alone. It has been adapted into a play, a musical, and multiple film versions. Ashford’s other juvenile writings were later published, including <i>The Hangman’s Daughter</i>, a short novel she considered her finest work. As an adult, she did not continue to write.</p>

		<summary type="text">An account of one man’s survival in London during the Great Plague of 1665.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The Plague is a disease that has a long and tragic history alongside humanity’s development of tightly-packed cities. <i>A Journal of a Plague Year</i> is a first-person narrative account of London’s last great plague outbreak in 1665, which killed an estimated 100,000 people in just 18 months.</p>
			<p>Though written in the first-person perspective by Daniel Defoe, he was only 5 years old during the outbreak. The initials at the end of the work, “H. F.,” suggest that <i>Journal</i> is based on accounts of Defoe’s uncle, Henry Foe.</p>
			<p>This highly readable short novel is fascinating not just as a historical account, but in its description of how people reacted to a deadly disease that they understood to be contagious, but yet had no cure for. Defoe derides quack doctors who killed more than they saved, and then themselves succumbed to plague. He tells of people turning to religion; of people driven mad by the death around them and raving in the streets; of people fleeing to the country, and of others barricading themselves in their homes. The ways people reacted in 1665 could be the very same ways people might have reacted today to a mysterious, deadly, and highly contagious outbreak.</p>

		<summary type="text">Shipwrecked on a remote tropical island, a resourceful Englishman manages to survive alone for many years.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is one of the most popular books ever written in the English language, published in innumerable editions and translated into almost every language of the world, not to mention the many versions created in film, television and even radio. First published in 1719, it can also claim to be one of the first novels ever written in English.</p>
			<p>Written in the form of an autobiography, it describes the life of the eponymous narrator Robinson Crusoe. A wild youth, he breaks away from his family to go to sea. After many adventures including being captured and made into a slave, he is eventually shipwrecked on a remote island off the coast of South America. Crusoe is the only survivor of the wreck. He is thus forced to find ways to survive on the island without any other assistance. His first years are miserable and hard, but he ultimately manages to domesticate goats and raise crops, making his life tolerable. While suffering from an illness, he undergoes a profound religious conversion, and begins to ascribe his survival to a beneficent Providence.</p>
			<p>Crusoe lives alone on the island for more than twenty years until his life changes dramatically after he discovers a human footprint in the sand, indicating the undeniable presence of other human beings. These, it turns out, are the native inhabitants of the mainland, who visit the island only occasionally. To Crusoe’s horror, he discovers that these people practice cannibalism. He rescues one of their prisoners, who becomes his servant (or “man”) Friday, named for the day of the week on which he rescued him, and together, their adventures continue.</p>

		<summary type="text">One man’s journey through a psychedelic alien landscape of philosophy, religion, life, and death.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>On hearing the title <i>A Voyage to Arcturus</i>, one might picture an astronaut strapping themselves into a rocket and flying into space for a swashbuckling adventure. Nothing could be further from what this book actually is.</p>
			<p><i>Voyage</i> is in fact a fascinating, bizarre, bewildering, and thought-provoking sort of acid-fueled <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>: a philosophical allegory told through the frame of a psychedelic gender-bending journey to an alien planet.</p>
			<p>After a terrifying seance, the protagonist, Maskull, is offered the chance of an adventure on a different world. He agrees, and the reader follows him on his blood-soaked path through lands representing different philosophies and ways of life as he searches for the world’s godhead, Surtur. Or is it Crystalman?</p>
			<p><i>Voyage</i> features fiction wildly ahead of its time, and is hardly classifiable as either science fiction or fantasy; one might even say that the book is better approached as a philosophical work than a straightforward narrative. It’s not a book for a reader seeking simple fiction, but rather for a reader seeking a thoughtful, imaginative, and totally unexpected exploration of philosophy and of life.</p>
			<p>Decades ahead of its time, <i>Voyage</i> was praised by contemporaries like C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, and by modern authors like Clive Barker and Alan Moore. Many modern reviewers consider it a masterpiece of 20th century fiction and the work of an underappreciated genius. A century later it boasts a significant cult following, having inspired modern sequels by authors including Harold Bloom, as well as movies, plays, albums, and even operas.</p>

		<summary type="text">An aristocratic detective unravels the mystery of a body deposited in a bathtub in 1920s England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Whose Body?</i>, published in 1923, is the first in a long and very popular series of mystery novels written by Dorothy L. Sayers and featuring her aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey.</p>
			<p>In this novel we are introduced to Wimsey, his imperturbable and multi-skilled butler Bunter, and his close friend Charles Parker of Scotland Yard as they come together to investigate an extremely mysterious incident: the naked body of a man, wearing a golden pince-nez, has been discovered in the bath of a bewildered tenant of a flat in Battersea. There’s a good deal of humor in the book, carefully balanced against the grim reality of murder.</p>
			<p><i>Whose Body?</i> was well-received on first publication, and provided a basis for Sayer’s successful career as a novelist. In sum, she wrote some eleven Wimsey novels as well as several short stories featuring the characters. Nevertheless, it appears that she herself felt that her translation of Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i> was her greatest literary work.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young English woman falls in love while on tour in Italy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Room With a View</i>, perhaps E. M. Forster’s lightest novel, was also one long in gestation—he began it as early as 1901, and only published it in 1908.</p>
			<p>In it we meet young Lucy Honeychurch and her cousin Charlotte Bartlett, who have gone on tour to Italy. During their stay they meet a series of interesting characters, including George Emerson, the son of an eccentric gentleman. The conflict between Lucy’s choice of the unusual George, or the her more conventional English suitor Cecil, forms the crux of Forster’s critique of contemporary English society.</p>
			<p>Despite the novel being a societal critique, the prose is light and studded with Forster’s easy witticisms. In 1958 Forster added an appendix elaborating on what occurred to the main characters after the novel’s end: the two world wars figure largely in their futures.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three children discover a wonderful garden and castle, and come into possession of a magic ring which entangles them in many strange adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> is a novel for young readers by Edith Nesbit, who was writing in the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in Britain. As in her other children’s books, it begins in the everyday world but quickly brings in the fantastical and magical. A large part of the delight of Nesbit’s books is that her children behave in quite ordinary ways, getting into scrapes, getting dirty and their clothes torn, making decisions which seem right to them at the time but which are generally wrong-headed. It’s the contrast between the ordinariness of the children and the magical adventures they become involved in which makes the books so charming.</p>
			<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> alongside stories by Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle. The first book edition was published in 1907.</p>
			<p>In the story, Kathleen and her brothers Gerald and Jimmy find a way into a remarkable garden designed to create a Palladian landscape, full of statues and pseudo-Classical temples and buildings. It is not long before they come across a sleeping Princess. They wake her, and she introduces them to an item of real magical value, a ring which makes its wearer invisible. But once on, the ring won’t come off! “Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole business is,” comments the author, which is indicative of the simple and direct language she uses, and the humor of the books. Even the invisibility ring, however, is not quite as simple as it seems; and many interesting and amusing adventures follow.</p>
			<p>The magazine serialization and the first book edition of the novel was beautifully illustrated by H. R. Millar, and we have included reproductions of these illustrations in this Standard Ebooks edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">After their father is forced to leave them, three children and their mother must live in near-poverty in the country, where their lives are enlivened by the nearby presence of a railway line.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Railway Children</i> is Edith Nesbit’s most well-known and well-loved book for young readers. Since its first book publication in 1906, it has been made into movies, radio plays and television series several times, dramatised in the theatre, performed in actual railway stations and has even been turned into a musical.</p>
			<p>It tells the story of three children: Roberta, Peter and Phyllis, who with their mother are forced to leave their comfortable suburban home and go to live in a small cottage in the country, after their father is taken away from them for what at first seem inexplicable reasons. They live there very quietly, not going to school, whilst their mother writes stories and poems to earn a small income. The children’s lives, however, are greatly enlivened by their proximity to a nearby railway line and station, in which they take great interest. They befriend the railway staff and have several adventures in which they demonstrate considerable initiative and courage.</p>
			<p>One unusual topic touched on by the book is the then-current Russia-Japan war, which divided opinion in England. Nesbit was clearly opposed to the actions of the Tsarist government of Russia, and she introduces into the story a Tolstoy-like Russian writer who has escaped from a prison camp in Sibera, to which he was condemned for publishing a book espousing his liberal views.</p>

		<summary type="text">E. Pauline Johnson’s collection of legends and myths of the Squamish people.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Emily Pauline Johnson, who was also known by the Mohawk name Tekahionwake, was a Canadian poet and author born in 1861. Born to a Mohawk father and an English mother, she was known for introducing indigenous culture to a wider North American and European audience.</p>
			<p>In <i>Legends of Vancouver</i>, perhaps her best-known prose work, Johnson tells stories of the Squamish people, as relayed to her by Chief Joe Capilano, whom she befriended upon moving to Vancouver in 1909. She provides her own framing for these stories, placing them in the context of her relationship with the Squamish people.</p>
			<p>In 1911, a group of Johnson’s friends collected this series of stories, that had previously been published in the <i>Daily Province</i>, in order to raise funds to support her as she struggled with poverty and health issues. In the intervening years, <i>Legends of Vancouver</i> has become a foundational piece of Vancouver’s literary heritage.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>It’s 1913, and war is on the horizon. The disgraced English aristocrat, Everard Dominey, is stumbling through East Africa when he comes across his old classmate and lookalike—the German Baron von Ragastein. Shortly after their chance encounter, Dominey returns to England. But is it really him, or a German secret agent, looking to infiltrate English society?</p>

			<p>Oppenheim’s classic spy-thriller was enormously popular when it was first published in 1920, selling over a million copies, and leading to three major motion pictures. It is featured on The Guardian’s list of “1,000 Novels Everyone Must Read.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A gentleman bachelor gains an epic advantage of tiny proportions in this allegorical, Romantic, fairy-tale novel.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann was a contemporary of Ludwig von Beethoven: a composer himself, a music critic, and a late-German-Romantic-movement writer of novels and numerous short stories. His incisive wit and poetic imagery allow the reader to peer into the foibles of society and the follies of human psychology. (In fact, Hoffmann’s wit may have gotten him into a bit of legal trouble, as parts of <i>Master Flea</i> were censored and had to be reworked when authorities disliked certain satirical criticisms of contemporary dealings of the court system.)</p>
			<p>Join gentleman bachelor Peregrine Tyss as his life as a recluse takes a twist, when he gains an epic advantage of tiny proportions. Part proto-science-fiction and part Romantic fantasy, <i>Master Flea</i> follows the fate of a mysterious, captivating princess at the intersection of numerous suitors, human and insect. Like a lesson from a fable or a tale of classical mythology, Hoffmann’s fairy-tale allegory shows how seeking forbidden knowledge can poison the soul, and how following the heart can heal it.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young stowaway embarks on high-seas adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Edgar Allan Poe is famed for his unsettling short stories, but he also wrote a full-length novel, his only one: <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i>. Framed as the recollections of an adventurous stowaway, <i>Pym</i> begins as a swashbuckling adventure novel, and after growing increasingly weirder, ends on a surreal note worthy of the best of Poe’s short stories.</p>
			<p>Despite Poe himself calling it a “a very silly book,” <i>Pym</i> went on to become one of his most-translated and influential works, coloring the themes of future adventure and weird fiction writers like Jules Verne and H. P. Lovecraft. It continues to influence writers to this day.</p>

			<p>In <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, John Carter is transported to a Mars inhabited by strange civilizations and embarks on various adventures on his quest home.

		<summary type="text">A New York socialite struggles to maintain a place among her wealthy friends in the face of her own diminished finances and fading youth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The House of Mirth</i> is Edith Wharton’s biting critique of New York’s upper classes around the end of the 19th century. The novel follows socialite Lily Bart as she struggles to maintain a precarious position among her wealthy friends in the face of her own diminished finances and fading youth. Lily has resolved to gain social and financial security by marrying into wealth, but callous rivals and her own second thoughts undermine Lily’s plans.</p>
			<p>Wharton’s insights into high society were largely built on her own experiences growing up among the upper crust, and her confident portrayal of a morally lax aristocracy found an eager audience. The novel sold over a hundred thousand copies within a few months of its release and became her first great success as a published author.</p>

		<summary type="text">A square is pulled out of his reality by a sphere, and shown the meaning of three dimensions.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Flatland</i> is uniquely both a social critique and a primer on multi-dimensional geometry. Written in two parts in 1884 by Edwin A. Abbott, an English mathematician and theologian, it tells the story of a square living in Flatland: a two-dimensional realm. After a dream of a restrictive one-dimensional existence and the difficulties this poses, he is visited by a sphere from a three-dimensional space who wishes to enlighten him into the ways of “Upward, yet not Northward.”</p>
			<p>Edwin A. Abbott wrote other theological fiction and non-fiction (including several biographies), but he is best remembered for <i>Flatland</i>. While it was mostly forgotten after publication, it received a revived interest from the 1960s onwards, and has more recently had several sequels and film adaptations. This edition of is based on the second published edition and includes its preface, which in part attempts to address some of the contemporary accusations of misogyny.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> is a collection of forty-four love sonnets. Despite what the title suggests, Browning in fact composed the sonnets in English. She decided to frame them as “translations” because she was concerned they may have been too personal to publish. Fortunately her husband, Robert Browning, convinced her to publish them, and they went on to become some of the most famous and critically-acclaimed love sonnets to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of sketches about small town life in a changing mid-Victorian England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Cranford</i> was first serialized in Charles Dickens’ magazine <i>Household Words</i> between 1851 and 1853. The structureless nature of the stories, and the fact that Gaskell was busy writing her novel <i>Ruth</i> at the time the <i>Cranford</i> shorts were being published, suggests that she didn’t initially plan for <i>Cranford</i> to be a cohesive novel.</p>
			<p>The short vignettes follow the activities of the society in the fictional small English country town of Cranford. Gaskell drew from her own childhood in Knutsford to imbue her settings and characters with a nostalgic quality in a time when the societies and styles portrayed were already going out of fashion.</p>
			<p>Though not especially popular at the time of publication, <i>Cranford</i> has since gained an immense following, including at least three television adaptations.</p>

		<summary type="text">A romance begins over the wire between two telegraph operators.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ella Cheever Thayer used her experience of being a telegraph operator at the Brunswick Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, to write <i>Wired Love: A Romance of Dots and Dashes</i>. The story begins when Nathalie Rogers receives a call from another telegrapher, “C,” who manages to make her laugh. Little did they know, this was the beginning of an unusual romance (for the time period) between two people who don’t know anything about each other—not even what they look like. <i>Wired Love</i> was a bestseller for 10 years after it was published.</p>

		<summary type="text">A bank is robbed and only two men appear to have the means to have done it; Monsieur Lecoq must discern if it was one of them or an “impossible” third party.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A bank safe is robbed. Only two men have both the key and the combination to the safe. The police naturally look to the employee rather than the owner of the bank. But Monsieur Lecoq, as always, sees what everyone else misses. Was it one of the two? Or was it a seemingly-impossible third party? Only Lecoq will be able to determine it. But why doesn’t he want his involvement in the case known?</p>
			<p>Like Gaboriau’s two novels before it, <i>File No. 113</i> is a mystery with a Dickensian tragedy behind it. Men and women of good character, of bad character, and good character who make bad choices abound, and remind us that the best mysteries have great personalities inhabiting them.</p>

		<summary type="text">Monsieur Lecoq’s first case in which he tries to determine the identity of a man in custody for three murders.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The third Lecoq novel goes back to the beginning, to Monsieur Lecoq’s first case, the case that began his reputation as a master of detection, master of disguise, and master of detail. The case begins simply: Lecoq and several other policemen come upon a crime as it’s being committed. Three men are dead and the killer is in custody. But who is he? Lecoq and his companion officer spend months trying to figure it out, to no avail. Lecoq finally goes to visit his old mentor in order to gain some insight.</p>
			<p>The scene then changes to some fifty years previous; in the aftermath of Waterloo, some noblemen return from exile. One of them insults the character of a local who has acted honorably on the nobleman’s behalf, and the remainder of the novel is devoted to how those few minutes end up unravelling the lives of everyone present, and many who aren’t.</p>
			<p>Gaboriau again demonstrates his ability to mix detective mystery and Dickensian drama, and foreshadows the style of the first two novels of his more famous English cousin in detection.</p>

		<summary type="text">A widow is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and Monsieur Lecoq of the police arranges to have his mentor brought in to help solve the crime.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Considered by many to be the first detective novel, <i>The Lerouge Case</i> (aka <i>The Widow Lerouge</i>) introduces Monsieur Lecoq (later Inspector Lecoq), a former “habitual criminal” who becomes a police officer. Émile Gaboriau based Lecoq at least in part on an actual criminal-turned-police-officer, Eugène Vidocq, who went on to be the first director of the Sûreté. In this first book, Lecoq plays a relatively small part, the bulk of the mystery solving being done by Lecoq’s mentor Tabaret, an amateur detective.</p>
			<p>Gaboriau thus introduces both a police detective and an amateur detective at the same time. Many of the attributes now taken for granted in the mystery arena originated with Gaboriau and Lecoq—hyper attention to detail, mastery of disguises, amateur “agents” who assist the detective, and the above-mentioned amateur detectives that assist and sometimes out-perform the police versions.</p>
			<p>Gaboriau’s Lecoq novels were wildly successful until another amateur detective named Holmes made his appearance. Holmes even comments on Lecoq in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet"><i>A Study in Scarlet</i></a>, dismissing him as a “miserable bungler” in response to Dr. Watson’s question. Nevertheless, Arthur Conan Doyle was obviously influenced by Gaboriau and Lecoq, as many of Holmes’ traits can be seen first in Lecoq.</p>

		<summary type="text">A countess is murdered and suspects are quickly detained, but Lecoq is not satisfied and looks in a different direction to solve the case.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A murder is discovered. The authorities quickly arrest an obvious suspect. A detective spends hours at the scene in disguise before making himself known, and proceeds to minutely examine the evidence with the assistance of a doctor, among others, before proclaiming the answer lies in a completely different direction. One would be forgiven for thinking the detective must be a certain famous Englishman and his doctor companion.</p>
			<p>But this detective is French rather than English, a professional working for the police rather than an amateur, and indulges in candy lozenges rather than cocaine. If there is a straight line between Poe’s Dupin and Doyle’s Holmes, then Gaboriau’s Lecoq lies right in the middle of it. He is a master of disguise, he is proud and sometimes arrogant, he notices infinitesimal things others do not, he makes great leaps in deduction while others are struggling to take small steps. He is both strikingly similar and distinctly different than his more famous English “cousin.”</p>
			<p>Although Monsieur Lecoq appeared in Gaboriau’s first novel, there he played only a minor part. Here, he is the main attraction. Solving the murder of a countess and disappearance of a count requires all of Lecoq’s skills, and as he steadily unravels the mystery one sees the debt that is owed by all who came after him.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this, Gaboriau’s last Lecoq novel, Lecoq doesn’t make an appearance until the last few chapters of the book. In fact, it’s not clear who the protagonist(s) is/are until almost halfway through. They’re not missed, though, because the antagonists are a group of blackmailers of exhaustive ingenuity and knowledge, and piecing together the game they’re playing with several noblemen and women occupies all of one’s faculties for most of the book.</p>
			<p>Young love, old love, forbidden love, lost love, along with a couple of missing individuals: what is the blackmailer’s endgame? Will Lecoq be able to figure it out in time? Called “French sensational” in its day, the last appearance of Lecoq is still sensational today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A groundbreaking painter struggles to leave his mark on the bohemian art world of 19th-century Paris.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>His Masterpiece</i>, sometimes translated as “The Work” or “The Masterpiece,” is Zola’s 14th entry in his Rougon-Macquart series of novels. In it we see Claude Lantier, a painter with obvious talent, struggle to leave a revolutionary mark on the art world of 19th-century Paris. The novel deftly explores the themes of genius, poverty, purity in art, art as an beaurocratic institution, obsession, and madness.</p>
			<p>The book is notable not just for its accurate portrayal of the art world of the time, but also for the interesting personal details Zola incorporated into the book. Lantier is a pastiche of several famous painters Zola personally knew, including Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, and Édouard Manet; Lantier’s masterpiece is based on Manet’s revolutionary painting <i>Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe</i>; and the novel’s accuracy is even blamed on ending the long friendship between Zola and Cézanne. Zola himself includes a self-portrait, as the character Pierre Sandoz.</p>
			<p>Vizetelly’s translation is fresh and readable, and Zola’s rendition of Paris and the surrounding countryside is vibrant and engrossing. Rarely do we get such a close and engaging window into bohemian life in old Paris.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adopted child ends up tearing apart families in a quest for power and revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Returning from Liverpool, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Earnshaw brings with him a dirty, ragged, black-haired child called Heathcliff, and sets into motion a tale of destructive passions. The book’s two locations, the genteel Thrushcross Grange and the wild Wuthering Heights, serve as matching backgrounds to the characters of their occupants, as they struggle to gain the upper hand in marriage and power. All the while, the ghosts of the past seem to drive revenge more than inspire forgiveness.</p>
			<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> was Emily Brontë’s sole published novel before her early death at the age of 30. Published under the pen name of Ellis Bell, a shared surname with the pen names of her sisters, many assumed that such a book could only have been written by a man. Reviewers of the time praised its emotional power but were also shocked at the actions of its characters, and most agreed that it was impossible to put down. After the novel’s original publication in 1847 it was revised into a single volume in 1850, and over time has become a classic of English literature. The story has been reworked into plays, operas, films, TV dramatisations and a ballet, and has inspired many further works of art, music and literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">Epictetus instructs his students how to live the life of a Stoic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Raised a slave in Nero’s court, Epictetus would become one of the most influential philosophers in the Stoic tradition. While exiled in Greece by an emperor who considered philosophers a threat, Epictetus founded a school of philosophy at Nicopolis. His student Arrian of Nicomedia took careful notes of his sometimes cantankerous lectures, the surviving examples of which are now known as the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>.</p>
			<p>In these discourses, Epictetus explains how to gain peace-of-mind by only willing that which is within the domain of your will. There is no point in getting upset about things that are outside of your control; that only leads to distress. Instead, let such things be however they are, and focus your effort on the things that are in your control: your own attitudes and priorities. This way, you can never be thrown off balance, and tranquility is yours for the taking.</p>
			<p>The lessons in the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>, along with his <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/the-enchiridion/elizabeth-carter">Enchiridion</a></i>, have continued to attract new adherents to Stoic philosophy down to the present day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A brief handbook of advice for day-to-day living in the Stoic philosophical tradition.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Born a slave and lamed by his master, Epictetus studied Stoic philosophy while in captivity. Once freed, he survived Domitian’s banishment of all philosophers from Rome to settle in Greece, where he founded a school of philosophy. He quickly rose to prominence as a renowned Stoic scholar and teacher, and even though he was personally friendly with emperors, he kept a simple life.</p>
			<p><i>The Enchiridion</i> is a summary of practical advice compiled by Epictetus’ student Arrian. While based on <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/discourses/george-long">Epictetus’ lectures</a>, it’s not a philosophical treatise as much as it is a short handbook with practical suggestions on how to live a good and satisfying life. It remained popular for centuries with translations to different languages completed as early as 1493, and was even a common school text in Scotland during the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

		<summary type="text">An ancient Chinese storyteller charged with treason uses his beguiling tales to avoid conviction.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ernest Bramah’s <i>Kai Lung</i> stories are set in a fantastical ancient China and written with an oblique, ornate prose style that serves to mimic that of Chinese folk tales. The titular character is an itinerant storyteller and the books themselves are mostly collections of stories presented as if he were narrating.</p>
			<p><i>Kai Lung’s Golden Hours</i>, published in 1922, is the second of the Kai Lung books, and the first to have an overarching framing narrative and thus be published as a novel. In it we see Kai Lung brought before the court of the Mandarin Shan Tien, having been accused of treason by the Mandarin’s agent Ming-shu. Appealing to Shan Tien’s appreciation for refined narrative, Kai Lung tries to regain his freedom by spinning a series of beguiling tales filled with aphorisms and humorous understatement.</p>

		<summary type="text">A British expedition sets off to cross Antarctica, but when their ship is wrecked they have to face a long struggle for survival.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>South!</i> tells one of the most thrilling tales of exploration and survival against the odds which has ever been written. It details the experiences of the the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition which set off in 1914 to make an attempt to cross the Antarctic continent.</p>
			<p>Under the direction of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition comprised two components: one party sailing on the <i>Endurance</i> into the Weddell Sea, which was to attempt the actual crossing; and another party on board the <i>Aurora</i>, under the direction of Aeneas Mackintosh, sailing into the Ross Sea on the other side of the continent and tasked with establishing depots of stores as far south as possible for the use of the party attempting the crossing.</p>
			<p>Shackleton gives a highly readable account of the fate of both parties of the Expedition. Both fell victim to the severe environmental conditions of the region, and it was never possible to attempt the crossing. The <i>Endurance</i> was trapped in pack-ice in the Weddell Sea and the ship was eventually crushed by the pressure of the ice, leaving Shackleton’s men stranded on ice floes, far from solid land.</p>
			<p>Shackleton’s account of their extraordinary struggles to survive is as gripping as any novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two English friends go on a sailing trip that quickly turns thrilling as they stumble upon a sinister German plot.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Riddle of the Sands</i> is one of the earliest examples of the spy novel genre, and became hugely popular shortly after its publication. Childers carefully interweaves fiction with real-world places, events, and politics, making for an extremely convincing story of invasion—so convincing that some (perhaps erroneously) credit the novel with spurring the creation of new English naval bases. The framing device, where Childers pretends to be an editor presenting a factual account, only adds to the believability of the story.</p>
			<p>The novel begins with Carruthers, an official in the Foreign Office, accepting an invitation from his friend Davies for what he assumes is a pleasure trip on a sailboat in the Baltic sea. As the two embark on their journey, it quickly becomes apparent that not everything is at it seems on the German coast.</p>
			<p><i>Riddle</i> helped energize the spy novel genre, providing a template for countless authors to come, including Ian Fleming and John le Carré, and has been adapted numerous times for film, television and radio.</p>

		<summary type="text">A clergyman turned revolutionary challenges both God and empire in the politically turbulent times of mid 19th-century Italy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Gadfly</i> is set in 1840s Italy, at a time when the the country was chafing under Austrian rule. The titular character is a charming, witty writer of pointed political satires who finds himself running with a crowd of revolutionaries. The plot develops as the revolutionaries struggle against the government and as the Gadfly struggles with a mysterious hatred of the Church, and of a certain Cardinal.</p>
			<p>The novel, with its complex themes of loyalty, romance, revolution, and stuggle against both establishment and religion, was very popular in its day both in its native Ireland and other countries like Russia and China. In Russia, the book was so popular that it became required reading. Since its publication it has also been adapted into film, opera, theater, and ballet, and its popularity spurred Voynich to write sequels and prequels.</p>

		<summary type="text">Evelyn Underhill makes the case that mysticism is accessible and beneficial to everyone.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Surprisingly timeless and under the guise of “Christian Mysticism,” Underhill describes in 1914 what could rightly be called “secular mindfulness” today. Evelyn Underhill doesn’t use much Christian terminology, instead preferring to use words that may be considered “new age.” If one can get past the terminology, the “Practical Mysticism” allows anyone to explore the mystical aspects of their own worldview without necessarily betraying their prior deeply-held beliefs.</p>
			<p><i>Practical Mysticism</i> is not a guidebook for mystical practice, though it does provide some tips along the way. What it does give is an introduction and apology for the sufficiently motivated; those that see (or want to see) the world in a different way.</p>

			<p>Khaled is a hard-working and faithful genie who, in his zeal, goes a little too far and kills a faithless man. This puts him under scrutiny from the powers above, who curse him to live as a human. Since genies have no souls, he will vanish from existence when he dies; but, if he can find true love, he’ll be granted a soul and thus be allowed into heaven.</p>
			<p>Written in the style of the “oriental romances” popular in those days, <i>Khaled</i> was F. Marion Crawford’s favorite novel out of all of the ones he wrote in his successful career.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man comes of age during America’s Jazz Age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>This Side of Paradise</i> chronicles the coming of age of Amory Blaine, born to a wealthy midwestern family. It begins with Amory as a spoiled youth, doted on by his eccentric mother Beatrice. It follows him as he attends preparatory school and Princeton, and then briefly attempts but quickly abandons at a career in advertising. His service in World War I is mentioned but mostly glossed over. Covered in much more detail are his various romances: youthful dalliances, a correspondance-based relationship that ends as soon as the couple spends time together in person, a deep love with the debutant sister of one of his close friends, and an intense summer fling.</p>
			<p>The book shows Amory’s attempts to define himself as a person and find his place in a world rapidly changing through World War, the “Jazz Age,” and Prohibition. It provides the reader with a good picture of what life was like for a privileged young man of the era.</p>
			<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald’s first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i> was published in 1920 when he was 23 years old, and was widely praised by critics. The semi-autobiographical work launched his career as one of America’s most well-known writers. As a direct result of the publishing of the novel, Zelda Sayre (the inspiration for the character of the debutant Rosalind Connage) agreed to marry Fitzgerald. The couple became an icon of the excesses of the Jazz Age.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man is found dead in a hansom cab in the city of Melbourne, Australia, and a young man is accused of his murder.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i>, published in 1886, was the first novel by Fergus Hume. It begins with a sensational murder, as the body of a dead man is discovered in a hansom cab by the driver. Set in Melbourne, Australia, it presents an engaging story of crime and detection, with several unexpected twists and turns. It also gives a clear and interesting portrait of the colonial city at the peak of its 19th Century prosperity following a gold rush, a time when it was known as “Marvellous Melbourne.” The novel contrasts the comfortable lives of the rich and well-connected of the colony with the misery of those living in the noisome slums in the back-streets of the city.</p>
			<p>The novel, originally published in serial form in a local newspaper, achieved some initial local success when it was first released in book form, but the author then sold the rights to a British company.</p>
			<p>After warm initial reviews in England <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i> became not merely a best-seller but what today we would call a “blockbuster” in the United Kingdom, its English-speaking colonies and the United States. It was the best-selling mystery novel of the Victorian era, and apparently was part of the inspiration for Conan Doyle to begin writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>
			<p>Fergus Hume eventually left Australia and returned to England. Though little-known today, after the success of <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i> Hume went on to write more than a hundred additional novels in the crime genre, as well as several plays.</p>

		<summary type="text">The friendship between two well-heeled couples is a veneer over darker truths.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the height of <i xml:lang="fr">belle époque</i> Europe, an American couple⁠—the narrator John Dowell and his wife Florence⁠–⁠and a British couple⁠–⁠Leonora and the titular “good soldier” Edward Ashburnham⁠—meet and become firm friends. Travelling and socialising together, it’s a full nine years before the cracks start to show, but when they do the whole edifice starts tumbling to reveal the secrecy and lies concealed within.</p>
			<p><i>The Good Soldier</i> is a classic example of the unreliable narrator genre. With a charitable view, everything John Dowell retells is plausible, but it doesn’t take much critical thinking to reframe the story’s events as something entirely more sinister.</p>
			<p>The novel is now frequently ranked by critics as one of the great pieces of twentieth-century literature. Ford Madox Ford, already published many times over by this novel’s release, and along with collaborations with both Joseph Conrad and Ernest Hemingway, went on to create and edit the influential literature journals <i>The English Review</i> and <i>The Transatlantic Review</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl is moved to the English countryside where she starts restoring a neglected garden, and uncovers secrets in the process.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mary’s parents fall ill and die, forcing her to be transplanted from India to the English countryside. She arrives at a strange and foreign country manor, where she discovers a long-neglected garden and hears strange sobbing noises at night.</p>
			<p>Thus begins <i>The Secret Garden</i>, a children’s book with an unusually dense collection of themes, symbols, and motifs. Mary’s personal development mirrors her unraveling the secret of the hidden garden, and a subtle backdrop of magical realism adds a mysterious air to the proceedings.</p>
			<p>Contemporary reception left <i>The Secret Garden</i> largely unnoticed, eclipsed by Hodgson’s other work, <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>. Since then, however, the book’s reputation has steadily grown, with modern critics considering it one of the finest children’s books of the 20th century.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a swindler in 17th-century Spain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Francisco de Quevedo holds the status of a man-of-letters in the same pantheon as Cervantes; but despite that, <i>Pablo de Segovia</i> is his only novel. Quevedo had circulated the manuscript privately for several years before it was published in 1626 without his permission. The novel is partly a satire of contemporary Spanish life, and a caricature of the various social strata Pablo encounters and emulates.</p>
			<p>Pablo himself is a low-born person who aspires to become a gentleman, but despite his best efforts he repeatedly fails and is eventually forced to become a “sharper,” or rogue. His failures give Quevedo an avenue to expound on his belief that attempting to break past your social class can only lead to disorder; and that despite one’s best efforts, bettering oneself is largely impossible. Pablo’s stumbling from misfortune to misfortune is a farce that helped cement Quevedo’s reputation as a literary giant.</p>

		<summary type="text">A British wine merchant on business in France stumbles across a syndicate with something to hide, and resolves to discover their secret.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Pit-Prop Syndicate</i> is a story from the beginning of the golden age of crime fiction. Seymour Merriman, a British wine merchant on business in France, happens upon a syndicate manufacturing pit-props⁠—beams used to prop up mine tunnels⁠—but his eye is caught by one odd detail: their lorry’s numberplate mysteriously changes. With the help of his friend Hilliard from the Excise department they dig deeper and uncover a dangerous conspiracy.</p>
			<p>Freeman Wills Crofts was a civil engineer, turned author of crime fiction. Though somewhat forgotten today, his style was widely appreciated at the time, and still finds fans of those who like a puzzle where all the loose ends are tied up. During his career he wrote over thirty crime novels; <i>The Pit-Prop Syndicate</i>, published in 1922, was his third.</p>

			<p><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, one of Nietzsche’s four “late period” works, is a philosophical treatise organized into nine parts and 296 short individual sections.

		<summary type="text">Inflated by his own ambition, Raskolnikov murders a pawnbroker then faces the inevitable consequences.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Crime and Punishment tells the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, an ex-student who plans to murder a pawnbroker to test his theory of personality. Having accomplished the deed, Raskolnikov struggles with mental anguish while trying to both avoid the consequences and hide his guilt from his friends and family.</p>
			<p>Dostoevsky’s original idea for the novel centred on the Marmeladov family and the impact of alcoholism in Russia, but inspired by a double murder in France he decided to rework it around the new character of Raskolnikov. The novel was first serialised in <i>The Russian Messenger</i> over the course of 1866, receiving instant public success, and it was published in a single volume in 1867. Presented here is Constance Garnett’s translation of 1914.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man living alone in St. Petersburg writes memoirs describing his alienation from modern society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Notes from Underground</i> is a fictional collection of memoirs written by a civil servant living alone in <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg. The man is never named and is generally referred to as the Underground Man. The “underground” in the book refers to the narrator’s isolation, which he described in chapter 11 as “listening through a crack under the floor.”</p>
			<p>It is considered to be one of the first existentialist novels. With this book, Dostoevsky challenged the ideologies of his time, like nihilism and utopianism. The Underground Man shows how idealized rationality in utopias is inherently flawed, because it doesn’t account for the irrational side of humanity.</p>
			<p>This novel has had a big impact on many different works of literature and philosophy. It has influenced writers like Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche. A similar character is also found in Martin Scorsese’s <i>Taxi Driver</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Notes from Underground</i> was published in 1864 as the first four issues of <i>Epoch</i>, a Russian magazine by Fyodor and Mikhail Dostoevsky. Presented here is Constance Garnett’s translation from 1918.</p>

		<summary type="text">A dispute over inheritance between father and son escalates into a family feud.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Dmitri Karamazov and his father Fyodor are at war over both Dmitri’s inheritance and the affections of the beautiful Grushenka. Into this feud arrive the middle brother Ivan, recently returned from Moscow, and the youngest sibling Alyosha, who has been released into the wider world from the local monastery by the elder monk Zossima. Through a series of accidents of fate and wilful misunderstandings the Karamazovs edge closer to tragedy, while the local townspeople watch on.</p>
			<p><i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> was Fyodor Dostoevsky’s final novel, and was originally serialised in <i>The Russian Messenger</i> before being published as a complete novel in 1880. This edition is the well-received 1912 English translation by Constance Garnett. As well as earning wide-spread critical acclaim, the novel has been widely influential in literary and philosophical circles; Franz Kafka and James Joyce admired the emotions that verge on madness in the Karamazovs, while Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Satre found inspiration in the themes of patricide and existentialism.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Fyodor Sologub’s translated short stories, ordered by date of the publication of their translation.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Fyodor Sologub was a Russian poet, novelist and playwright, working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His work generally has a downcast outlook with recurring mystical elements, and often uses anthropomorphic objects or fantastical situations to comment on human behaviour. As well as novels (including the critically acclaimed <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub/the-little-demon/john-cournos_richard-aldington">The Little Demon</a></i>), Sologub wrote over five hundred short stories, ranging in length from half-page fables to nearly novella-length tales.</p>
			<p>While most of his short stories were not contemporaneously translated, both John Cournos and Stephen Graham produced English compilations and contributed individual stories to publications such as <i>The Russian Review</i> and <i>The Egoist</i>. This collection comprises the best individual English translations in the public domain of Sologub’s short stories, presented in chronological order of the publication of their translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">In a provincial town a Russian poet draws himself away from society to create his utopia.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hidden in the forest, the poet Trirodov attempts to secede from the troubled society of early twentieth century Russia to build his own utopia: a school for the quiet children he cares for. Nothing is ever that easy though, and his personal connections to the outside world tie him into the political whirlwind of agitators, factions and power struggles that threaten his solitude.</p>
			<p><i>The Created Legend</i> portrays a stark contrast to the protagonists of Sologub’s earlier work <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub/the-little-demon/john-cournos_richard-aldington"><i>The Little Demon</i></a>, even though the setting is the same town of Skorodozh. There, they varied from at best well-meaning to actively malignant; here the lead characters are idealistic, and isolate themselves from the trials of Russian society in an attempt to maintain their idealism. Trirodov sees beauty and mystery everywhere he looks, and (following the title) works to create his own legend.</p>
			<p>This volume, originally titled “Drops of Blood,” is the first of the “Created Legend” trilogy and the only one translated contemporaneously into English. It was received with some bewilderment by critics: the combination of current affairs and magical events proved too strange for many. However, treated as an early example of magic realism and with the benefit of hindsight, the setting and symbolism is less shocking and more readily accessible to the modern reader.</p>

		<summary type="text">A banal and paranoid school teacher falls slowly into madness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ardalyon Borisitch Peredonov believes himself better than his job as teacher, and is hoping that the Princess will be able to promote him to the position of Inspector. Unfortunately for him his connection to the Princess is through his fiancée Varvara, and she has her own plans. With little sign of the desired position his life of petty cruelty escalates, even as his grip on reality begins to break apart and his paranoia manifests itself in hallucinations of a shadowy creature.</p>
			<p>Finished in 1907, <i>The Little Demon</i> (alternatively translated as <i>The Petty Demon</i>) is Fyodor Sologub’s most famous novel, and received both popular and critical attention on its publication despite its less-that-favorable depictions of provincial Russian life. Its portrayal of Peredonov as a paranoid character simultaneously both banal and bereft of goodness is an essay on the Russian concept of <i xml:lang="ru">poshlost</i>; a theme that makes an appearance in many other Russian novels, not least Chichikov in Gogol’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nikolai-gogol/dead-souls/d-j-hogarth"><i>Dead Souls</i></a>. This translation (primarily by John Cournos) was published in 1916, and includes a preface by Sologub for the English-speaking reader.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two friends, solving a perceived crime, stumble upon a club for people who have invented their own method of employment.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Charles Swinburne and his friend, the private detective Rupert Grant, are startled when Major Brown recounts the things that happened to him that morning. Along with Rupert’s brother, the ex-judge Basil Grant, they launch headlong into their investigation only to discover that the antagonist is a member of the Club of Queer Trades. Over the course of six short stories, the secrets of the Club come to light in surprising ways.</p>
			<p><i>The Club of Queer Trades</i> was one of G. K. Chesterton’s earlier works, and was originally serialized in <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> in 1904 before being collected into a novel in 1905. In recent years it was produced as a six-part radio drama by the BBC.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Father Brown is a Catholic priest, but a slightly unusual one in that he’s <em>also</em> an amateur detective. Unlike his more famous literary cousin Sherlock, Father Brown takes a less analytical and more intuition-oriented approach to solving the many murders that he happens to come across.</p>
			<p>This collection of short murder mysteries is Brown’s first appearance on the literary stage. In it we see him practicing his unique brand of sleuthing alongside his sometimes-partner, the reformed master criminal Flambeau.</p>

		<summary type="text">An undercover policeman infiltrates a mysterious Anarchist group.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Sometimes described as thrilling, sometimes as comic, and sometimes as metaphysical or spiritual, <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> is perhaps a little of each. The tale begins when an undercover policeman infiltrates a mysterious Anarchist group. As the novel progresses, things become more comic and improbable, and eventually evolve in to a sort of abstract, dreamlike state. Filled with Christian allegory, <i>Thursday</i> is a glittering, fascinating exploration of good versus evil and theology through the lens of adventure, wit, and the surreal.</p>

		<summary type="text">A satire set in far-future London where the king, who was chosen at random, only cares about a good joke.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</i>, like so many Chesterton novels, deftly straddles the fence between humor and philosophy. The place is London, in the far-future year of 1984. Inexplicably, not too much has changed since the turn of the century—except that the king is chosen at random. Things quickly take a turn for the worse when the people randomly select an imbecile who only cares about a good joke.</p>
			<p>With the new prankster king in place, the novel continues on with surprisingly action-packed breeziness, exploring themes of identity, patriotism, politics, and government.</p>

		<summary type="text">Amateur detective and Catholic priest Father Brown solves mysteries in this second collection of Father Brown short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Father Brown, G. K. Chesterton’s crime-solving Catholic priest, is back in this second collection of Father Brown short stories.</p>
			<p>In this collection, Brown is joined by his sidekick, the former arch-criminal Flambeau. Brown is directly involved in the investigations less frequently than in <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton/the-innocence-of-father-brown">The Innocence of Father Brown</a></i>, and several of the stories don’t even feature murder. Despite this, the shorts each feature Brown solving a mystery using his characteristic insight into human nature and morality.</p>
			<p>The stories in this collection were initially published in various serials, including <i>McClure’s Magazine</i> and <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>. Chesterton arranged them in this collection almost in order of publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious presence terrorizes the Paris Opera.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“When I die and am in Heaven,” Christine Daaé’s father said, “I will send the Angel of Music to you.” It is with these words still in her ears years later that Christine accepts the disembodied voice that speaks to her to claim that divine title, and to give her singing lessons within her dressing room at the Paris Opera, as the fulfillment of her beloved father’s promise. And when those lessons lead her to a performance that astonishes the whole city, who could doubt but that the Angel had indeed come?</p>
			<p>Yet there is another, more sinister presence stalking about the Opéra Garnier: the Opera Ghost. A creature who not only makes inconvenient demands⁠—such as the exclusive use of Box Five at every performance, as well as a sizable retainer paid monthly—⁠but who also hangs a man for wandering into the wrong part of the Opera’s cavernous cellars, and sends a chandelier plunging down onto the heads of a packed house when his demands are not met.</p>
			<p>But is the Opéra truly host to so many supernatural phenomena, or could it be that the Angel and the Opera Ghost are in fact one and the same? And could it be also that he is far less angel than demon? And if so, will Christine realize her peril before it is too late?</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of idealistic Barbara Undershaft, a Major in the Salvation Army, who does not want to be connected to her father’s “tainted” money.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Major Barbara</i> is a three-act play that premiered at the Court Theatre in 1905, and was subsequently published in 1907. It portrays idealist Barbara Undershaft, a Major in the Salvation Army, and her encounter with her long-estranged father who has made his fortune as a “dealer of death” in the munitions industry. Barbara doesn’t wish to be associated with her father’s ill-gotten wealth, but can’t prevent him from donating to the Salvation Army and eventually converting her family to his capitalist views on how best to help the poor.</p>
			<p>In the preface, Shaw addresses his critics and explicates his actual attitudes towards the Salvation Army, versus the attitudes and fates portrayed by his characters and responded to by the critics. He continues on to discuss the issues of wealth and poverty, religion and science, and how they all fit into his views of society.</p>
			<p><i>Major Barbara</i> is one of the most controversial of Shaw’s work and was greeted with decidedly mixed reviews, yet it endures as one of his most famous plays.</p>

		<summary type="text">An arrogant upper-class professor bets a colleague he can transform a simple flower girl into a “Duchess” in just six months.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Pygmalion</i> is a 5-act play by George Bernard Shaw. It was written in 1912 and first produced in 1913. The plot revolves around Professor Henry Higgins’ bet with a colleague over whether he can transform a low-class flower girl, Liza Doolittle, into the equivalent of a Duchess in just 6 months. Pygmalion was a Greek mythological figure who fell in love with a sculpture he had carved and was a popular theme in Victorian drama.</p>
			<p>Most people would be familiar with the characters Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins from the hit 1956 musical <i>My Fair Lady</i>, which was adapted from <i>Pygmalion</i>, though the plots differ in small but significant ways. In particular Shaw wanted to avoid any sense of a “happy ending” and, after viewing a performance of the play where an extra scene had been added, he wrote a sequel which definitively states what came after. The sequel was included in the published edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">In the neighborhood of a rural English town in the 1830s, several men and women struggle with love, marriage and fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“George Eliot” was the pen-name of Mary Ann Evans, one of the greatest of English novelists of the Victorian era. Her long novel <i>Middlemarch</i>, subtitled <i>A Study of Provincial Life</i>, is generally considered to be her finest work.</p>
			<p>Published in eight installments between 1871 and 1872, <i>Middlemarch</i> tells the intertwined stories of a variety of people living in the vicinity of the (fictional) midlands town of Middlemarch during the early 1830s, the time of the great Reform Act. The novel is remarkable for its realistic treatment of situation, character and relationships and also demonstrates its author’s accurate knowledge of political issues, medicine, politics, and rural economy. Yet it also includes several touches of humor.</p>
			<p>The novel’s main characters include: Dorothea Brooke, a religiously-inclined and very intelligent young woman who marries a much older man believing that she can assist him in his scholarly studies; Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a doctor who comes to Middlemarch to further his medical research and implement his ideas for treatment, but whose plans are thrown into disarray by an unwise marriage; Fred Vincy, an idle young man, the son of the town’s Mayor, who gets into a mire of debt; and several others.</p>
			<p>The initial reception of the novel by critics was mixed, with a number of unfavorable reviews, but its reputation has grown through time and <i>Middlemarch</i> is now generally considered to be one of the best novels ever written in English.</p>

		<summary type="text">A miserly weaver’s isolated life is transformed by the theft of his precious money and the sudden appearance of an abandoned infant, whom he adopts and raises.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Silas Marner</i>, author George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) introduces an embittered linen weaver who withdraws from society after a betrayal of trust. He retreats to work his loom or count and re-count his accumulated gold and silver. The abrupt theft of his money sends Marner into despair, which is interrupted just as suddenly by the appearance of an abandoned infant on his hearth. Marner adopts and raises the child, finding a new place among his community.</p>
			<p><i>Silas Marner</i> was well-received at the time of its release for its “fairy tale” charm, and has since gained appreciation for Eliot’s treatment of alienation, religious feeling and community. It has remained popular ever since its publication and has been adapted many times to stage and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">The lives of two young people are thrown into disarray when their father, the owner of a mill, is bankrupted by an unwise legal dispute.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1860, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> was the second novel published by George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans). Set in the late 1820s or early 1830s, it tells the story of two young people, Tom and Maggie Tulliver, from their childhood into early adulthood. Their father, Jeremy Tulliver, owns Dorlcote Mill on the river Floss, and the children grow to adolescence in relative comfort. However Mr. Tulliver is litigous and initiates an unwise legal suit against a local solicitor, Mr. Wakem. The suit is thrown out and the associated costs throw the Tulliver family into poverty, and they lose possession of the mill.</p>
			<p>The main character of the novel is Maggie Tulliver, an intelligent and passionate child and young woman, whose mental, romantic, and moral struggles we follow closely. As in Eliot’s other novels, the author shows a realistic and sympathetic understanding of human behavior.</p>
			<p><i>The Mill on the Floss</i> is regarded as a classic of English literature, and has been made into both a film and a television series.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man awakes in Fairy Land, where he takes part in a series of strange adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Phantastes</i> was published in 1858. It tells the story of Anodos, who, on coming of age, is examining the effects of his deceased father. To his astonishment, in doing so he sees an apparition of a fairy woman, who tells him that he has some fairy blood and conveys him to Fairy Land.</p>
			<p>In Fairy Land Anodos undergoes a long series of strange adventures and spiritual experiences. He is frequently under threat, at first from malevolent trees, and later from his own evil Shadow. At one point he discovers Pygmalion’s cave and sees the form of a beautiful woman enclosed in transparent alabaster. He falls instantly in love with this woman and contrives to free her from the stone, but she flees from him. Later, he encounters the Arthurian knight Sir Percivale, who has just come off the worst of an encounter with the evil Maid of the Alder-Tree. Eventually, after many trials and hazards, Anodos encounters Sir Percivale again and becomes his squire. Together they carry out deeds of chivalry before Anodos eventually returns to the mundane world.</p>
			<p><i>Phantastes</i> is now regarded as a classic of the fantasy genre and has been an important influence on later generations of fantasy writers, including such names as C. S. Lewis.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Persian barber embarks on a quest to save a city from the clutches of a tyrant and his magical hair.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Shaving of Shagpat</i> isn’t just George Meredith’s first published novel, it’s also his only foray into fantasy literature. <i>Shagpat</i> sold poorly in its day despite good reviews, and after its disappointing sales Meredith pursed a career as a writer of romantic fiction instead. Despite its poor financial reception, <i>Shagpat</i> enjoys a good modern reputation and remains a classic of fantasy literature, with George Eliot going so far as to call it a “work of genius.”</p>
			<p>The book is set in the medieval fantasy-Persia of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> and other oriental romances. Shibli Bagarag, a poor but talented barber, encounters a mystical crone named Noorna. Together they embark on a quest to save the city of Shagpat from a tyrant who holds the city under his command by virtue of the powers of his magical hair. On the way they battle genies and afreets, save princesses, hunt for treasures, and so on.</p>
			<p>Meredith’s language is purposefuly florid, evoking the richness of the setting, and his frequent usage of quotations and aphorisms from “the poet” give the fantasy a decidedly literate air.</p>

		<summary type="text">A chronicle of the lives of three working-class women from the early 20th century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Three Lives</i> are the stories of three working-class woman from Bridgepoint⁠—a town loosely based on Baltimore⁠—in the early twentieth century. Each story tells of the hopes, loves, romances and sadnesses of the women as they live their lives.</p>
			<p>Written in a unconventional style, the lives of the three women are uncovered through their layered conversations and interactions more than through detailed depictions. The book is notable for its descriptions of homosexual romance, something that at the time in the USA wasn’t accepted (indeed, Gertrude Stein moved with her partner to Paris to be able to live openly).</p>
			<p><i>Three Lives</i> was Gertrude Stein’s first published book, and although the sales weren’t as expected it was generally well received by critics. It’s considered today to be among her more accessible books, and is a regular on English literature curricula.</p>

		<summary type="text">After her husband is wrongly convicted of murder, a young Sardinian woman driven into poverty is forced to divorce him and marry a wealthy but abusive man in order to survive.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Giovanna and Costantino Ledda are a happily married young Sardinian couple living a contented village existence with their small child and extended family. But after Costantino is wrongly convicted of murdering his uncle and imprisoned, the now‐impoverished Giovanna reluctantly divorces him under a newly enacted divorce law and marries Brontu Dejas, a wealthy but cruel drunkard who has always coveted her. While enduring a slave’s existence within this new marriage as well as the community’s derision of her as the “wife with two husbands,” the broken Giovanna is unexpectedly reunited with an embittered Costantino after his exoneration and early release from prison, and the two resume their now‐illicit relationship.</p>
			<p>An exploration of hypocrisy, expiation, and the human disruption of a supernatural order that remorselessly reasserts itself, <i>After the Divorce</i> is set in an insular society of ancient, religious roots grappling with the intrusion of modern, secular social mores and is among the earliest of the serious works on which Grazia Deledda’s literary reputation is based. Deledda—the first Italian woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature—critiqued the social norms of her native Sardinia through <i>verismo</i> depictions of the struggles of the lower classes, into which she wove elements of her own personal tragedies.</p>

		<summary type="text">A middle-class country wife tries to satisfy her yearnings for a luxurious life by engaging in various affairs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Madame Bovary</i>, often ranked among the greatest novels of all time, is considered Gustave Flaubert’s masterpiece, with authors from Henry James to Proust to Nabokov heaping it with praise.</p>
			<p>The novel tells the story of Madame Bovary, a commoner wife of a country doctor, and her attempts to escape the drudgery of day-to-day mediocrity by engaging in adulterous affairs and overspending on luxuries. She remains unsatisfied even though her husband adores her and they want for little, and her shallowness eventually leads to their ruin.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Madame Bovary</i>, with its careful but charming description of the banality of everyday life, is considered the first great example of literary realisim in fiction novels. Eleanor Marx-Aveling’s translation, though over a hundred years old, is remarkably fresh and smooth, and is a pleasure even for modern readers.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories by Gustave Flaubert.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Gustave Flaubert was an influential novelist who had both the characteristics of a romanticist and a realist. The short stories in this collection put that dichotomy on display.</p>
			<p>Flaubert wrote the first story, “The Dance of Death” when he was only 17 years old. It is written in a play format—though sometimes referred to as a prose poem—and features a conversation between Death, Satan and Nero. “The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller” is a story about Julian the Hospitaller, a man who shares some similarities with Oedipus; “A Simple Soul” tells the story of a servant girl named Felicité; and lastly “Herodias” retells the beheading of St. John the Baptist.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Australian man struggles to reclaim his love from the clutches of an evil mastermind.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Guy Newell Boothby, born in Adelaide, was one of the most popular of Australian authors in the late 19th and early 20th century, writing dozens of novels of sensational fiction.</p>
			<p><i>A Bid for Fortune, or Dr. Nikola’s Vendetta</i> is the first of his series of five books featuring the sinister mastermind Dr. Nikola, a character of gothic appearance usually accompanied by a large black cat, and who has powers of mesmerism.</p>
			<p>In this first novel, the protagonist is a young Australian, Richard Hatteras, who has made a small fortune in pearl-diving operations in the Thursday Islands. With money in his pocket, he decides to travel. Visiting Sydney before taking ship for England, he meets and falls in love with the daughter of the Colonial Secretary, Sylvester Wetherell. As the story moves on, it is revealed that Wetherell has fallen foul of the evil Dr. Nikola, who has developed a devious scheme to force Wetherell to submit in to his demands to give him a mysterious oriental object he has acquired. The life and liberty of Hatteras’ lady-love are imperilled as Nikola’s plot moves on, and Hatteras has to make strenuous efforts to locate and free her.</p>
			<p>Boothby’s novels, particularly the Dr. Nikola books, achieved considerable popular success, particularly in his native country of Australia. A study of library borrowings in the early 20th Century has shown that Boothby’s works were almost as frequently borrowed in Australia as those of Charles Dickens and H. Rider Haggard.</p>

		<summary type="text">On a planet being exploited for its resources, the discovery of a possibly-sentient native species creates consternation and conflict.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Little Fuzzy</i> is a science fiction novel set on the planet Zarathustra, a world rich in natural resources being exploited by a huge chartered company from Earth. Jack Holloway is a free-lance sunstone miner working on the outskirts of civilization when he encounters a small, fuzzy animal which turns out to be remarkably intelligent. He soon begins to suspect that “Little Fuzzy” and his family are more than just clever animals, but in fact a new sapient alien species. Such a proposition is directly opposed to the interests of the chartered Zarathustra Company, and conflict ensues.</p>
			<p>Published in 1962, <i>Little Fuzzy</i> rapidly gained popularity due to the charming nature of the little aliens and the well-handled tensions of the plot. It is today considered to be a classic of the genre, though perhaps considered to fall into the category of juvenile fiction. It was followed by a sequel, <i>Fuzzy Sapiens</i> in 1964.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tragic starfarer seeks revenge in this epic space opera.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Initially serialized in <i>Analog</i> magazine between 1962 and 1963, <i>Space Viking</i> takes place after the events of H. Beam Piper’s earlier serialization, <i>The Cosmic Computer</i>. <i>Space Viking</i> is a classic space opera: what begins as an interstellar tale of revenge turns into a swashbuckling adventure yarn, and finally into a meditation on empire-building and galactic governance with direct allusions to our modern history.</p>
			<p>This richness of content makes <i>Space Viking</i> a unique read. The reader begins by expecting a lighter sci-fi adventure, and early on the plot delivers; but as events transpire, the reader is deftly drawn away from action scenes and into a more nuanced discussion on governance and human nature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man returns to his home planet with news about Merlin, the military super-computer rumoured to be hidden somewhere on his world.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Cosmic Computer</i> is a 1963 science fiction novel by H. Beam Piper based on his short story “Graveyard of Dreams,” which was published in the February 1958 issue of <i>Galaxy Magazine</i>.</p>
			<p>The action largely takes place on the planet Poictesme, which is full of abandoned military installations and equipment—hence the novel’s original name, <i>Junkyard Planet</i>. Young Conn Maxwell returns from Earth with long-awaited news about Merlin, a military computer with god-like abilities long rumored to be hidden somewhere on Poictesme. Though convinced that the story is just a myth, Conn and his father use the purported search for Merlin to drive the revitalization of the planet’s economy. In the process, they discover far more than they expected.</p>
			<p>As was typical for science fiction novels of the pulp era, there is little character development and women play a minor role, with romance given only a token treatment. The emphasis is on the conflicts over the spoils of the planet and the fiercely competitive search for the titular “cosmic computer.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphan raised by his aunt and uncle struggles as a young man to integrate into upper class society after receiving a substantial inheritance from his grandfather.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Kipps</i> is the story of Arthur “Artie” Kipps, an illegitimate orphan raised by his aunt and uncle on the southern coast of England in the town of New Romney. Kipps falls in love with neighbor friend Ann Pornick but soon loses touch with her as he begins an apprenticeship at a drapery establishment in the port town of Folkestone. After a drunken evening with his new friend Chitterlow, an aspiring playwright, Kipps discovers he is to inherit a house and sizable income from his grandfather. Kipps then struggles to understand what his new-found wealth means in terms of his place in society and his love life.</p>
			<p>While today H. G. Wells is best known for his “scientific romances” such as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-time-machine">The Time Machine</a></i> and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-island-of-doctor-moreau">The Island of Doctor Moreau</a></i>, Wells considered <i>Kipps</i> his favorite work. Wells worked closely with (some say pestered) his publisher Macmillan to employ creative promotional schemes, and thanks to a cheap edition sales blossomed to over 200,000 during the first two decades of publication. It was during this period that his prior futuristic works became more available and popular with American audiences.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories by H. G. Wells in a variety of genres ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>H. G. Wells is probably best known for his imaginative longer works, such as his novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-war-of-the-worlds"><i>The War of the Worlds</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-invisible-man"><i>The Invisible Man</i></a>; but he was also a prolific short story writer. This Standard Ebooks edition of his short fiction includes fifty-four of Wells’ stories, written between 1894 and 1909 and compiled from the collections <i>The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents</i> (1895), <i>The Plattner Story and Others</i> (1897), <i>Tales of Time and Space</i> (1899), <i>Twelve Stories and a Dream</i> (1903) and <i>The Country of the Blind and Other Stories</i> (1911). They are presented here in approximate order of first publication.</p>
			<p>The stories vary wildly in genre and theme, ranging from tales of domestic romance, to ghost stories and tropical adventures, to far-future science fiction. Interestingly, many of the stories deal with the exciting but also frightening prospect of heavier-than-air flight and aerial warfare, and it is worth noting that these stories were written some years before the Wright brothers first took to the air.</p>

		<summary type="text">A middle-aged man in early Edwardian England finds himself despairing at his failed business and marriage, and takes a drastic step to escape—with unexpected results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This work by H. G. Wells was first published in 1910. In contrast to Wells’ early speculative fiction works like <i>The Time Machine</i>, this is a comic novel set in the everyday world of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in England. Despite the less than happy life-story of Mr. Polly, it is an amusing book, enlivened by Polly’s inventive attitude towards the English language.</p>
			<p>Alfred Polly’s mother dies when he is only seven, and he is brought up by his father and a stern aunt. He is indifferently educated, and leaves school in his early teens to be employed as a draper’s assistant. As the years pass, he finds himself more and more disenchanted with his occupation, but it is too late to change it. Eventually his father dies and leaves him a legacy which may be enough to set up in business for himself. He sets up his own shop in a small town and stumbles into an unhappy marriage. The business is not profitable, and in his middle-age, unhappy and dyspeptic, Mr. Polly comes up with an idea to bring an end to his troubles. Things, however, do not go as he planned, and lead to an unexpected result.</p>
			<p>Wells’ later work often displays his passion for social reform. Here, that passion is less obvious, but nevertheless he demonstrates his sympathy for middle-class people raised like Mr. Polly with but a poor education and trapped into either dead-end jobs or in failing retail businesses.</p>
			<p><i>The History of Mr. Polly</i> was well-received by critics at the time of publication and was subsequently made into both a film and two different BBC television serials.</p>

		<summary type="text">A scientist named Griffin creates a serum to render himself invisible and subsequently descends into madness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Griffin, a scientist, has devoted his life to the study of optics. As his work progresses, he invents a method of making a person invisible. After testing the experiment on himself, he comes to realize that while the experiment was a complete success, he has no way of reversing his invisibility.</p>
			<p>Written in a time of rapid scientific progress and industrial development, Wells uses Griffin’s struggle with his condition and descent into obsession and madness to reflect on the dangers of unbridaled scientific progress untempered by compassion or humanity.</p>
			<p><i>The Invisible Man</i> was initially serialized in <i>Pearson’s Weekly</i> in 1897, after which it was published as a whole novel that same year.</p>

		<summary type="text">A shipwrecked man is rescued by a boat and left on a strange island owned by a physiologist who experiments in vivisection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i> is the narration of Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man who finds himself on a mysterious island full of humanoid animal creatures. He comes to find that these creatures are the work of Dr. Moreau, a man who experiments in vivisection, and his assistant Montgomery.</p>
			<p>The story of Dr. Moreau’s island began as an article in the January, 1895 issue of <i>Saturday Review</i>. It was later adapted into a novel. Its themes reflect concerns growing in the society of the day, like the cruelty of vivisection, degenerationism, and the theory of evolution.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Time Machine</i> is the novel that gave us the concept of—and even the word for—a “time machine.” While it’s not Wells’ first story involving time travel, it <em>is</em> the one that most fully fleshes out the concept of a device that can send a person backwards and forwards in time with complete precision. Time machines have since become a staple of the science fiction and fantasy genres, making <i>The Time Machine</i> one of the most deeply influential science fiction novels of the era.</p>

		<summary type="text">The first-person narrative of the Martian invasion of 19th-century Earth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>H. G. Wells’ classic tale of alien invasion has to this day never been out of print. Like many works of the era, it was originally published as a serial—though the publisher, <i>Pearson’s Magazine</i>, demanded to know the ending before committing to publication.</p>
			<p><i>The War of the Worlds</i>, with its matter-of-fact narrative style and deft mixture of contemporary science and fictionalized interstellar war machines, became an instant hit. Its themes of colonialism, social Darwinism, good and evil, and total war still resonate with modern-day readers, so much so that it’s been continuously adapted for screen, radio, television, comics, and print.</p>

		<summary type="text">An angel falls into the everyday world of 19th Century England and is bewildered and despirited by human life and society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> is an early work by H. G. Wells, published in the same year as <i>The Time Machine</i>. It takes a gentle, semi-comic approach to some of Wells’ social concerns by using the device of an angel fallen into our world from the Land of Dreams. This external observer, largely ignorant of the ways of humans and our society, is able to focus an unbiased eye on our failings.</p>
			<p>The story opens with a strange glare over the little village of Sidderford one night, observed by only a few. But then reports arise of a Strange Bird being seen in the woods. The Rev. Hilyer, the Vicar of Sidderford, is a keen ornithologist. He takes his gun and goes out to hunt this unusual specimen for his collection. He does indeed see a strange flying creature, shoots at it, and brings it down. To his horror, he finds that he has shot and wounded a man-like creature with wings—in fact, an Angel.</p>
			<p>The Vicar restores the Angel to health, but finds himself incapable of convincing others that this person really is an angel. The continuing clashes of the Angel’s idealistic points of view with the harsh reality of the human world are the core of this story.</p>
			<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> was well-received by critics and Wells’ contemporaries. Joseph Conrad praised it for its imaginative approach in a personal letter to Wells.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor boy, the son of a servant, rises to fortune on the back of his uncle’s patent-medicine scheme.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i>, published in 1909, is a semi-autobiographical novel by H. G. Wells. Though it has some fantastical and absurdist elements, it is a realist novel rather than one of Well’s “scientific romances.”</p>
			<p>The novel is written in the first person from the point of view of George Ponderevo, the son of the housekeeper at a large estate. He is made to feel his inferiority when he is banished after fighting with the son of one of the owner’s aristocratic relatives, and is sent to live with his own poor but religiously fervent relatives. He can’t abide or agree with their religious views and returns to his mother who sends him on to live with his Uncle, Edward Ponderevo, then a local pharmacist in a small town. Uncle Ponderevo, though, has grand plans, and eventually makes a fortune by selling a quack patent medicine he calls “Tono-Bungay.” George joins him in this endeavour and becomes rich himself, eventually turning his interests towards the new science of aeronautics. Meanwhile the Tono-Bungay scheme expands enormously and begins to topple towards its own destruction.</p>
			<p>Thoughout the novel, George comments cynically on England’s class system, the shabbiness of commerce, and the lies told in advertising. We also follow his unfortunate love life, his unwise marriage, his divorce, and his eventual reconnection with a woman he loved as a child.</p>
			<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i> met with a mixed reception on first release, but has since come to be considered as perhaps Wells’ finest realist novel, an assessment Wells himself shared.</p>

		<summary type="text">The complete U.S. public domain short fiction of horror legend H. P. Lovecraft.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft was one of the most influential writers of horror fiction in the early 20th century. His fame is mostly posthumous—he was only published in pulp magazines, and never saw financial success. Despite that, Lovecraft’s unique blend of gothicism, horror, and supernatural, set in an imagined but eerily-real New England, marked a gold standard for horror fiction for decades to come.</p>
			<p>Readers of modern fantasy and horror fiction will certainly recognize Cthulhu, the tentacle-mouthed god who lies asleep in a sunken Atlantean ruin; the <i>Necronomicon</i>, a grimoire of unspeakable power and horror penned by the “mad Arab” Abdul Alhazred; and the dark, twisted New England countryside of the Miskatonic Valley. These and other features take shape in Lovecraft’s stories, creating a backdrop of the bizarre and horrible behind seemingly day-to-day lives.</p>
			<p>This edition is small because verifying the U.S. public domain status of Lovecraft’s corpus is a difficult, if not impossible, academic exercise, and finding first-edition copies to transcribe is also difficult. This edition will be updated as more transcriptions become verified and available.</p>
			<p>Included in this edition are some of Lovecraft’s juvenalia—in particular, <i>The Alchemist</i> was written when he was just seventeen or eighteen.</p>

		<summary type="text">Allan Quatermain leads a group of adventurers into an unknown region of Africa in a search for fame and glory.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>King Solomon’s Mines</i> was published in September 1885, becoming an immediate best seller by tapping into people’s excitement for the unknown: in this case, the unexplored regions of Africa.</p>
			<p>Haggard wrote the novel in a very short period, between six and sixteen months, on a bet with his brother to try to match Robert Louis Stevenson’s <i>Treasure Island</i>. In the process he created a new literary genre known as the “Lost World” genre, which would later influence other writers like Arthur Conan Doyle and H. P. Lovecraft.</p>
			<p>The book tells the tale of Allan Quatermain, an adventurer and hunter, who is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good to help them find Curtis’ lost brother, who went missing while trying to find the fabled King Solomon’s Mines.</p>
			<p>This book has spawned multiple adaptations in the form of movies, comics, and TV shows.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Norwegian sea captain’s widow who, no matter how much she tries, cannot escape the ghosts of the past.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in 1881, when melodrama and farce were still at their peak of popularity, Ibsen’s <i>Ghosts</i> is a three-act tragedy that explores uncomfortable, even forbidden themes. It is also a highly critical commentary on the morality of the day. The play centers around the widow of a prominent Norwegian sea captain whose son returns home and, with tragic consequences, revives the ghosts of the past that she has long labored to put to rest.</p>
			<p><i>Ghosts</i> immediately became a source of controversy for its inclusion of topics like venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia, and it was banned from being performed in England for many years. Its arrival signals a shift in the nature of theatre and, despite negative criticism, it was translated into other languages and performed in Sweden, Germany, and New York within a few years of its debut. It stands now as one of the works considered to have ushered in the era of modern drama.</p>

		<summary type="text">Thoreau describes his visit to Quebec in 1850.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the fall of 1850, Henry David Thoreau briefly visited Quebec with Ellery Channing. In this book, Thoreau describes the cities and homes, people and customs, and rivers and plants of that part of Canada.</p>
			<p>He describes what he sees as anachronistically servile, crown-loving traditions in Canada—and how these have stunted the imaginations and lives of the residents—and he contrasts these with the more independent, revolutionary Yankee heritage of his home country.</p>
			<p>He also turns his characteristically keen eye on the artifacts and natural phenomena around him, from the stone walls of Quebec’s Old City battlements to the rivers and cascades of the surrounding countryside.</p>
			<p>Parts of this book were originally published in Putnam’s Magazine as “An Excursion to Canada.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Thoreau’s report on his social experiment of solitude, simplicity, and self-reliance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Walden</i> is one of the more famous transcendentalist tracts in modern American literature. First published in 1854, <i>Walden</i> is an account of Thoreau’s famous experiment in solitude: spending over two years alone in a cabin near the wilderness.</p>
			<p><i>Walden</i> is broken into sections that meditate on single themes: economy, reading, sounds, solitude, visitors, and so on. The style is complex, weaving back and forth between simple, home-spun prose and complex allegory, metaphor, and allusion. This makes <i>Walden</i> an interesting read because while it may seem accessible on the surface, it’s a book that requires deep and repeated reading to fully appreciate its many complexities.</p>

		<summary type="text">The daughter of a wealthy American art collector marries a poor Italian Prince.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>The Golden Bowl</i>, an impoverished Italian aristocrat comes to London to marry a wealthy American, but meets an old mistress before the wedding and spends time with her, helping her pick out a wedding gift. After their marriage, his wife maintains a close relationship with her father, and their relationship becomes strained.</p>
			<p>Completed in 1904, Henry James himself considered <i>The Golden Bowl</i> one of his best novels, and it remains one of critics’ favorites. Along with <i>The Wings of the Dove</i> and <i>The Ambassadors</i>, the novel represents James’ “major phase,” where he returned to the study of Americans abroad, which dominated his earlier career. The novel focuses almost entirely on four central characters, and explores themes of marriage and adultery in an intricate psychological study, which some critics have even suggested anticipates the style of stream-of-conscious writing.</p>

		<summary type="text">A governess moves in to a haunted manor.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>One of the most famous ghost stories in literature, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> earned its place in the annals of influential English novellas not for its qualities as a gothic ghost story, but rather for the many complex and subtle ways the reader can come to opposing conclusions as to tale’s very nature. Are the ghosts the governess sees real, or are they figments of her quiet insanity?</p>
			<p><i>The Turn of the Screw</i> was originally published as a serial, and later went through many revisions by James himself. Though there aren’t any overt suggestion that James intended his novella to be anything but a simple ghost story, the ambiguitiy in the narrative has captured the imagination of generations of readers and critics.</p>

		<summary type="text">Captain Ahab, having lost his leg to the white whale Moby Dick, travels the world on a quest for vengeance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“Call me Ishmael” says <i>Moby Dick</i>’s protagonist, and with this famous first line launches one of the acclaimed great American novels. Part adventure story, part quest for vengeance, part biological textbook and part whaling manual, <i>Moby Dick</i> was first published in 1851. The story follows Ishmael as he abandons his humdrum life on shore for an adventure on the waves. Finding the whaler <i>Pequod</i> at harbour in Nantucket, he signs up for a three year term without meeting the Captain of the ship, a mysterious figure called Ahab. It is only well into the voyage that Ahab’s thirst for vengeance against the eponymous white whale Moby Dick⁠—and the consequences⁠—become clear.</p>
			<p>The novel is semi-autobiographical: Herman Melville had had his own experience of whaling, having spent a year and a half aboard a whaling ship and further years travelling the world in the early 1840s. Herman used the knowledge gained from his experiences and wide reading on the subject to furnish <i>Moby Dick</i> with an almost encyclopaedic quality at times. The literary style varies widely, veering from soliloquies and staged scenes to dream sequences to comprehensive lists of ships provisions, but everything serves to further detail the world that’s being painted.</p>
			<p>Presented here is the New York edition, which was published later than the London edition and reverted numerous changes the original publishers had made, as well as including the initially omitted epilogue.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Herman Melville’s short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Melville’s pen ranges far and wide in this collection of his short stories and novellas, with subjects including a faraway mountain lodge, a magnificent rooster, a haunted table, and of course the inimitable scrivener Bartleby, whose tale is now viewed as one of the great English short stories. While his earlier novels had been well received, by this point in his career his star had waned, and it was only in the early twentieth century that his work, including these short stories, started to get the recognition it still enjoys today.</p>
			<p>This volume collects Melville’s short stories verified to be in the US public domain, in the order they were originally published in <i>Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</i> and <i>Putnam’s Monthly Magazine</i> (along with “The Piazza” which was written for the collection <i>The Piazza Tales</i>). The racism displayed in “Benito Cereno” against the African slaves is somewhat shocking to modern readers given our greater understanding of their story, but was common in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man embarks on a spiritual journey through India.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hermann Hesse wrote <i>Siddhartha</i> during a period in his life in which he suffered what he described as a “sickness with life.” He claimed to be unable to complete the book because he had not experienced the kind of nirvana that Siddhartha, the main character, wants to achieve—so Hesse surrounded himself with sacred Buddhist and Hindu teachings and lived as a reculse in order to complete this work.</p>
			<p><i>Siddhartha</i> is a short, simple tale of a man’s quest to achieve enlightenment and happiness. Over twelve short chapters the reader follows Siddhartha through his time as a young adult, to his exploration of spirituality as a traveling ascetic, to his delvings in lust, business, and greed, to his time as an old man. At each stage of his life Siddhartha yearns for nirvana, finally achieving it only after realizing that it’s all of life’s experiences that form it, not the teachings of any one man.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Siddhartha</i> remains an influential text in new Western spirituality.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Iliad</i> is one of the oldest works of Western literature, dating back to classical antiquity. Homer’s epic poem belongs in a collection called the Epic Cycle, which includes the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey/william-cullen-bryant">Odyssey</a></i>.

			<p>This epic poem begins with the Achaean army sacking the city of Chryse and capturing two maidens as prizes of war. One of the maidens, Chryseis, is given to Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaeans, and the other maiden, Briseis, was given to the army’s best warrior, Achilles. Chryseis’ father, the city’s priest, prays to the god Apollo and asks for a plague on the Achaean army. To stop this plague, Agamemnon returns Chryseis to her father, but then orders Achilles to give him Briseis as compensation. Achilles refuses.</p>

			<p>This epic poem follows Ulysses, one of the Greek leaders that brought an end to the 10-year-long Trojan war. Longing for home, he must travel across the Mediterranean Sea to return to his kingdom in Ithica; unfortunately, our hero manages to anger Neptune, the god of the sea, making his trip home agonizingly slow and extremely dangerous. While Ulysses is trying to return home, his family in Ithica is also in danger. Suitors have traveled to the home of Ulysses to marry his wife, Penelope, believing that her husband did not survive the war. These men are willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man tries to climb up the cutthroat Parisian social ladder during the Bourbon Restoration.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Father Goriot</i>, today considered one of Balzac’s most important works, is part of his novel sequence <i>The Human Comedy</i>. It’s the first of Balzac’s novels to feature recurring characters, a technique that he famously developed in his subsequent novels.</p>
			<p>Set in Paris during the Bourbon Restoration of the early 1800s, <i>Father Goriot</i> follows Eugène de Rastignac, a student born to noble roots but little means, as he tries to climb the social ladder in Paris. The impoverished Goriot is staying at the same boardinghouse as Rastignac—and Rastignac sees opportunity in Goriot’s richly-married and elegant daughters.</p>
			<p>The novel has been widely praised for its realist portrayal of Parisian life of various social classes, and its deep influence on French literature is still felt today. While it had chapter breaks when it was initially serialized, Balzac removed them when compiling his definitive edition of <i>The Human Comedy</i>, a change that is preserved in this edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Gothic tale of chivalry, romance, and horror.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Castle of Otranto</i> is considered to be the first “Gothic” novel—that is, containing a combination of tropes, like hidden passages, haunted paintings, mysterious sounds, skeletal ghosts, ancestral curses, and unexplained deaths, that essentially invented the genre later made famous by authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, or Henry James. Walpole made a point of creating a novel that blends supernatural elements with more realistic depictions of characters and events.</p>
			<p>The plot centers around Manfred, the lord of Otranto Castle, who has just witnessed the death of his son under mysterious circumstances, just as his son was about to be married. Manfred is thrust into a galloping and melodramatic series of events that lean heavily on the supernatural.</p>
			<p>Walpole initially published <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> under a pseudonym, claiming that his work was a translation of an ancient Italian manuscript. This framing, along with the purposely archaic writing style, gives the supernatural airs of the novel a decidedly authentic flavor. In later editions Walpole acknowledges his authorship.</p>
			<p><i>Otranto</i> remains a fast-paced and familiar read, thanks to the variety of recognizable tropes it introduced and made popular.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Ivan Bunin’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ivan Bunin was a Russian author, poet and diarist, who in 1933 (at the age of 63) won the Nobel Prize in Literature “for the strict artistry with which he has carried on the classical Russian traditions in prose writing.” Viewed by many at the time as the heir to his friend and contemporary Chekhov, Bunin wrote his poems and stories with a depth of description that attracted the admiration of his fellow authors. Maxim Gorky described him as “the best Russian writer of the day” and “the first poet of our times,” and his translators include D. H. Lawrence and Leonard Woolf.</p>
			<p>This collection includes the famous <i>The Gentleman from San Francisco</i>, partially set on Capri where Bunin spent several winters, and stories told from the point of view of many more characters, including historic Indian princes, emancipated Russian serfs, desert prophets, and even a sea-faring dog. The short stories collected here are all of the available public domain translations into English, in chronological order of the original Russian publication. They were translated by S. S. Koteliansky, D. H. Lawrence, Leonard Woolf, Bernard Guilbert Guerney, and <i>The Russian Review</i>.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arkady, a university graduate, returns from St. Petersburg to his father’s estate with his mentor Bazarov—a nihilist.</p>
			<p><i>Fathers and Children</i> (also known as <i>Fathers and Sons</i>) is a novel written in 1862 by Russian writer Ivan Turgenev and published in Moscow by <i>The Russian Messenger</i>.</p>
			<p>The main theme of the novel is the conflict between two generations—the “fathers,” the liberal serf owners, and the “children,” nihilists who reject their authority and traditions.</p>
			<p>Turgenev’s novel also helped popularize the term “nihilism,” especially after the word’s use by an influential Russian nihilist movement in the 1860s.</p>
			<p>Despite being harshly criticized in Russia, the novel was very well received in Europe, being praised by influential novelists like Gustave Flaubert and Guy de Maupassant, making it the first Russian novel to gain recognition in the Western literary world.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mischievous and cocky young boy, Peter Pan, takes Wendy and her brothers on adventures on a fantasy island consisting of mermaids, pirates, Native Americans, and fairies.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Peter Pan, a young boy who refuses to grow up, takes Wendy to the lost boys on the fantasy island of the Neverland to be their mother. Wendy’s two brothers, John and Michael, accompany them on their many adventures, including skirmishes with the Native Americans who reside there, and battles with pirates, led by Pan’s nemesis Captain Hook, who is said to be feared even by Captain Flint and Long John Silver.</p>
			<p><i>Peter and Wendy</i>, J. M. Barrie’s most famous work, was influenced by Barrie’s relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family and the death of his older brother, who, by dying in his youth, would remain a young boy forever. It began as a play first performed in 1904, and then was later published as a novel in 1911. A large number of adaptations including plays, television, and films have since been produced.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of adventures in London, including those of the narrator and a little boy named David, and Peter Pan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Little White Bird</i> is generally divided into three sections: the first chronicles the narrator’s life in London, beginning with how he came to know a little boy named David (who joins him on his adventures), and describes other matters of his everyday life.</p>
			<p>The second section tells the story of how Peter Pan came to be a “betwixt-and-between” and his adventures in Kensington Gardens, including his interactions with the birds as well as the fairies hidden in the park.</p>
			<p>Finally, the third section of the book revisits London with the narrator and David. The two make brief visits to Kensington Gardens and embark on a new adventure to Patagonia.</p>
			<p><i>The Little White Bird</i> is the first story to include the famous Peter Pan character, two years before <i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up</i>, the play that made the character famous. While <i>The Little White Bird</i> can be described as a prelude to the play, inconsistencies such as Peter Pan’s age make the two stories incompatible.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man in the west coast of Ireland is lionized after he claims to have killed his father.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A young man stumbles into a rural public house in western Ireland claiming to be on the run after having killed his father. He immediately becomes a source of awe and an object of adoration, and even love. But what happens when the inhabitants of this tiny village find out all is not as the stranger claims?</p>
			<p>J. M. Synge first presented <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on the 26th of January, 1907. The performance immediately offended Irish nationalists by seemingly insulting the Irish people and language, and the general public, by being an offense against moral order. Before it was even finished, it was disrupted by a riot that soon spread out into the city. When it was performed in 1911 in the U.S., the play was again greeted with scorn and the company arrested for an immoral performance.</p>
			<p>But as Synge himself attempts to explain in the preface to his play, rather than attack Irish Gaelic, he wanted to show the relationship between the imagination of the Irish country people and their speech, which is “rich and living,” and that his use of such language reflects reality in a way missing from other modern drama. He later insisted that his plot was not to be taken as social realism, but died in 1909 before the play finally gained broader appeal in the wider world. Since then the significance of <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> has been recognized and celebrated both for its characterizations and its rich use of dialect.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young lawyer witnesses a suspicious death on a late-night train and investigates what turns out to be a murder.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Charing Cross Mystery</i> follows a young lawyer, Hetherwick, who happens to be on a train alongside a former police inspector who dies suddenly in front of him. The other man in the carriage runs off at the next stop and vanishes. Hetherwick takes it upon himself to investigate what turns out to be a murder.</p>
			<p>J. S. Fletcher originally wrote the story in 1922 for a weekly magazine, who called it <i>Black Money</i>. It was published in a single volume in 1923 as <i>The Charing Cross Mystery</i> and immediately had to be reprinted because of its popularity.</p>
			<p>The novel is a classic Edwardian detective novel where the plot twists and turns as more and more people become involved in the investigation, both as investigators and as suspects.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of five of Le Fanu’s short stories, including his most notable work “Carmilla,” presented as cases of the occult detective Dr. Martin Hesselius.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>In a Glass Darkly</i> is a collection of five short stories, presented as posthumous papers of cases of the “metaphysical” doctor Dr. Martin Hesselius. First appearing in “Green Tea,” originally published in 1869, Dr. Hesselius became one of the first literary occult detectives.</p>
			<p>J. Sheridan Le Fanu often made revisions to his work and re-released several under new names, including two from <i>In a Glass Darkly</i>: “The Familiar,” a revised version of “The Watcher,” published in 1851, and “Mr. Justice Harbottle,” a revised version of “An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street,” published in 1853.</p>
			<p>Most notably, this collection includes what is likely Sheridan Le Fanu’s most famous work, “Carmilla.” A young countess turned vampire, Countess Mircalla uses the anagram of her name, Carmilla, to disguise herself in order to prey on unsuspecting young women. “Carmilla” would heavily influence Bram Stoker’s <i>Dracula</i>, which would later become the prototypical vampire archetype.</p>

		<summary type="text">An heiress becomes ward to her disreputable uncle with an unsavory past, tainted by the apparent suicide of a man to whom he owed a large gambling debt, and must help clear his name.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Uncle Silas</i> is told from the account of Maud Ruthyn, an heiress living with her reclusive father, Austin Ruthyn. She learns about her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, and his past reputation marred by gambling and the apparent suicide of a man to which Silas owed a large gambling debt that occurred in a locked room in Silas’ residence.</p>
			<p>In order to clear the Ruthyn name of the rumors of Silas’ past, Austin names Silas as Maud’s guardian through Austin’s will upon his death. Also noted in Austin’s will, Silas would inherit the fortune left to Maud should she die while under his ward. Maud befriends her cousin Millicent and quickly adjusts to life under Silas’ care, despite his often frightening demeanor. Although Silas has proclaimed that he’s a newly reformed Christian, Maud becomes increasingly suspicious of her uncle’s motives as life for her becomes increasingly unpleasant.</p>
			<p>The story of Maud Ruthyn and her uncle Silas evolved through multiple iterations, beginning with the short story “A Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess” in 1839, before ultimately becoming the three-volume novel published in 1864. This ebook reproduces a revised, two-volume version released a year later.</p>

		<summary type="text">Goethe’s first major work, a novel of unrequited love, longing, and deterioration into sorrow.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 leveled the city of Lisbon and surrounding areas, and killed perhaps as many as 100,000 people. It came at a decisive time in the history of western thought: the melding of Faith, Philosophy, and Science into a post-enlightenment rational view of the universe. In some sense mankind had just begun to believe he had the universe figured out when the universe struck back with a tragedy so terrible in scale it could not be fit into any box of understanding. It was not predicted. It could not have been prevented. It was not rational. And it certainly could not have been the will of a benevolent God.</p>
			<p>Lisbon was only one moment in a much larger context—industrialization was upending a pre-historic way of life, science was upending nature, and the first great republics in America and France were about to upend previously unchalleneged forms of government. It was the awe, inspiration, and uncertainty of all this change that gave rise, ultimately, to Romanticism in art, literature, and music.</p>
			<p>J. W. von Goethe is, by some accounts, the father of the romantic period in literature, or at least the proto-romantic <i xml:lang="de">Sturm und Drang</i> (“Storm and Stress”) period. And <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> was its genesis. It was Goethe’s first major work, an immediate sensation upon publication, and made Goethe a household name.</p>
			<p>While Voltaire parodied rationalism in <i>Candide</i>, Goethe transcended it with the semi-autobiographical story of Werther, a young man governed more by his emotions than his reason, whose only employment is his delight in the romantic ideals of the pastoral lives he finds in the rural town of Walheim. There he also finds Charlotte, and in her an idealized but unobtainable old-world domesticity. Werther’s internal dialog about his growing obsession with Charlotte, and his inability to cope rationally with the fact that she is engaged to—and in love with—another man, form the bulk of the book in the form of a series of ever more intense letters to a friend.</p>
			<p>Werther’s descent into sorrow has captivated readers for centuries, helped by Goethe’s intensely beautiful prose (translated here by R. D. Boylan), enchanting imagery, and obvious reverence for nature and a dying past.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of a domesticated dog’s return to a primitive state in the late 19th-century Yukon.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Jack London spent nearly a year in Alaska and the Klondike, mining for gold and braving the Alaskan winter. There he was inspired to write what would become <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, one of his most famous novels. <i>The Call of the Wild</i> tells the tale of a domesticated dog stolen from his California family and sold to sledders in Alaska. As he adapts to the harsh and wild environment, he slowly sheds domestication and returns to his primal roots.</p>
			<p><i>The Call of the Wild</i> was London’s first major success, ensuring he’d have a readership for his future writing and paving the way for him to become one of the first writers to amass a fortune from just his fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">Literary critic Humphrey Van Weyden is pressed into service aboard a seal-hunting schooner by its cruel, ruthless, but intelligent captain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After a ferry accident on San Francisco Bay, literary critic Humphrey Van Weyden is swept out to sea only to be rescued by the seal-hunting schooner <i>Ghost</i>. Wolf Larsen, the captain of the <i>Ghost</i>, is brutal and cynical but also highly intelligent, and he has no intention of returning Van Weyden to shore. Van Weyden is forced to serve on the <i>Ghost</i>, leaving behind his comfortable world ashore and entering into a psychological battle with Larsen on the sea.</p>
			<p>Jack London wrote <i>The Sea-Wolf</i> in 1904 following the success of his previous novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london/the-call-of-the-wild">The Call of the Wild</a></i>, and it has gone on to become one of his most popular novels. London actually served on a sealing schooner during his early career and that experience lends a gritty realism to his depiction of life at sea. The book can be read as a psychological thriller and adventure novel, but can also be read as a criticism of Nietzche’s Übermensch philosophy with Wolf Larsen embodying a “superman” lacking conventional morality.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wild half-wolf survives a harsh existence before finding love and domestication in civilization.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>White Fang</i> is Jack London’s companion novel to <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london/the-call-of-the-wild">The Call of the Wild</a></i>. In <i>The Call of the Wild</i> we follow a dog’s journey from domestication to wilderness, but in <i>White Fang</i> we see the opposite: a wild wolf-dog captured by men and eventually domesticated.</p>
			<p>White Fang’s journey isn’t an easy one; both the wild and civilization have their share of brutal violence. But he eventually seems happy in a home with a loving family. When read side-by-side with <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, <i>White Fang</i> poses an interesting question: is wilderness <em>really</em> an improvement over civilization? Is there one right way to live?</p>

		<summary type="text">A shipwrecked sailor travels through a portal to a lost world populated by fantastic creatures and a strange civilization.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder</i> is perhaps James De Mille’s most popular book; sadly, De Mille didn’t get to see this novel grow in popularity, as it was first serialized posthumously, in <i>Harper’s Weekly</i>. De Mille had written the novel before the “lost world” genre had become saturated, meaning many of the ideas were fresh and original for the time in which it was written. But, since he didn’t succeed in publishing it during his lifetime, by the time the novel was made public other authors like H. Rider Haggard had made the ideas and plot clichéd.</p>
			<p>The novel itself tells the tale of a shipwrecked sailor, Adam More, who passes through a mysterious underground passage into a hidden land deep in the Antarctic, kept warm by a hidden volcano. The land is populated by an ancient civilization whose views on life and wealth are the polar opposite of those held in British society of the time—they view death and poverty as the highest religious and social achievements. As More adventures through the strange land, he encounters fantastic dinosaurs, lovelorn princesses, and the classic kind of adventure that foreshadows the pulp novels of the next century.</p>

		<summary type="text">Fifteen short stories about middle-class life in early 20th-century Dublin.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dubliners</i> is a collection of picturesque short stories that paint a portrait of life in middle-class Dublin in the early 20th century. Joyce, a Dublin native, was careful to use actual locations and settings in the city, as well as language and slang in use at the time, to make the stories directly relatable to those who lived there.</p>
			<p>The collection had a rocky publication history, with the stories being initially rejected over eighteen times before being provisionally accepted by a publisher—then later rejected again, multiple times. It took Joyce nine years to finally see his stories in print, but not before seeing a printer burn all but one copy of the proofs. Today <i>Dubliners</i> survives as a rich example of not just literary excellence, but of what everyday life was like for average Dubliners in their day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wealthy young woman decides to take on the role of patroness and matchmaker to a young protégé, with considerably less than successful results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Emma</i> is one of Jane Austen’s best-loved novels. Its eponymous heroine, Emma Woodhouse, is described in the very first paragraph as “handsome, clever, and rich… and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.” In other words, she has lived a pampered, protected life and consequently is somewhat unrealistic in her regard for herself and her own abilities.</p>
			<p>She befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of dubious parentage and no money and determines to improve her prospects. As part of this project, Emma decides to become a matchmaker between Harriet and the Reverend Mr. Elton, a vicar in the nearby town. Things, however, do not go as smoothly as she had imagined.</p>
			<p>The novel provides an insight into the distinctions in the rigid class structure of England in the Regency period, and the social barriers to marriage between persons considered to be of superior and inferior rank.</p>
			<p><i>Emma</i> was published in 1815, the last of Austen’s novels to be published while she still lived. It received a generally very positive reception, and was well reviewed (though anonymously) by Sir Walter Scott. Criticisms of the novel, such as they were, centered around its supposed lack of plot, though its treatment of character was recognized and applauded. Today it is regarded as one of Austen’s best works. The novel has been adapted many times for theater, movies and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman meets again with a lover whose marriage proposal she had been persuaded to reject several years ago.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Persuasion</i> was published in 1817, six months after Jane Austen’s death, and is the last novel she completed in full.</p>
			<p>The novel tells the story of Anne Elliot, now in her late 20s, the daughter of a vain and improvident baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. The family is in debt, and in order to save money they rent their noble property to a retired Admiral and his wife. This brings Anne into unexpected and initially unwelcome contact with the brother of the Admiral’s wife, Captain Frederick Wentworth. Eight years previously, Wentworth had proposed to Anne, only to be rejected by her after she was persuaded by an older friend that he was an unsuitable match. He reacted angrily to this rejection, and she has had no contact with him since.</p>
			<p>At the time Anne rejected him, he was a poor naval officer, without his own command. In the years since, however, during the course of the Napoleonic Wars, he has become rich, as many successful captains did during that period. Anne dreads encountering him again, and when she does, he shows no sign of his earlier affection, instead paying his attentions to Anne’s younger sisters-in-law, and Anne must keep her emotions under strict control. Time and circumstance eventually lead to happier results.</p>
			<p><i>Persuasion</i> was well-regarded on publication and has slowly increased in popularity since. It has been turned into several television series and movies.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Regency-era novel of manners in which five women try to adjust to their new neighbor, an eligible gentlemen.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i> may today be one of Jane Austen’s most enduring novels, having been widely adapted to stage, screen, and other media since its publication in 1813. The novel tells the tale of five unmarried sisters and how their lives change when a wealthy eligible bachelor moves in to their neighborhood.</p>
			<p>This edition removes Austen’s pathological use of period-dashes and many ungrammatical commas to make the reading smoother for modern readers.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two sisters take long journeys to love in early nineteenth-century England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When her husband dies and leaves his estate to his son from a former marriage, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dashwood and her three daughters are offered a cottage on the estate of a distant relative. The two oldest daughters fall in love, only to find that the objects of their affection have secrets that throw their lives into an uproar. The reserved oldest daughter and impetuous, fiery middle daughter will take very different journeys to discovering the true worth of their respective beaus.</p>
			<p>Published in 1811, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, was largely written fifteen years earlier, when Austen was approximately the same age as her older protagonist Elinor. It was published anonymously (“By A Lady”), possibly due to propriety, or perhaps because she wanted to avoid any negative publicity if the book was not well-received. She needn’t have worried; it sold out its first printing of a modest 750 copies. She used well-defined characters, humor, and satire to paint a vivid picture of life in the England of George III, with all of its manners, class issues, and unwritten rules of behavior. That it’s still being read over two hundred years later is a testimony to her brilliance.</p>

		<summary type="text">The humorous travelogue of a boating holiday down the Thames taken by three friends and their dog.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Three Men in a Boat</i> is one of the most popular English travelogues, having never been out of print since its publication in 1889 and causing its publisher to comment, “I cannot imagine what becomes of all the copies of that book I issue. I often think the public must eat them.”</p>
			<p>The novel itself is a brisk, light-hearted, and funny account of a two-week boating holiday taken by three friends up the Thames river. Jerome is a sort of everyman narrator, and even the stodgiest reader can sympathize with at least some of the situations and conundrums he and his friends find themselves in during their adventure.</p>
			<p>Interspersed between comic moments are slightly more serious descriptions of the picturesque villages and landscape the friends explore, making <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> not just a comic novel but an actual account of the life, times, and land of late 19th century greater London.</p>

		<summary type="text">An army general chases a network of German spies through Scotland, the Swiss Alps, and the First World War’s Western Front.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1919, <i>Mr Standfast</i> is a thriller set in the latter half of the First World War, and the third of John Buchan’s books to feature Richard Hannay.</p>
			<p>Richard Hannay is called back from serving in France to take part in a secret mission: searching for a German agent. Hannay disguises himself as a pacifist and travels through England and Scotland to track down the spy at the center of a web of German agents who are leaking information about the war plans. He hopes to infiltrate and feed misinformation back to Germany. His journey takes him from Glasgow to Skye, onwards into the Swiss Alps, and on to the Western Front.</p>
			<p>During the course of his work he’s again reunited with Peter Pienaar and John Blenkiron, who both appear in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan/greenmantle"><i>Greenmantle</i></a>, as well as Sir Walter Bullivant, his Foreign Office contact from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan/the-thirty-nine-steps"><i>The Thirty Nine Steps</i></a>.</p>
			<p>The title of the novel comes from a character in John Bunyan’s <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> to which there are many references in the book, not least of all as a codebook which Hannay uses to decipher messages from his allies.</p>
			<p>The book finishes with a captivating description of some of the final battles of the First World War between Britain and Germany in Eastern France.</p>

		<summary type="text">An expatriate returning to England after many years in South Africa is accused of a murder he did not commit, and has to flee from the police and other more dangerous pursuers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1915, <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> is a thriller set in Britain on the eve of the First World War.</p>
			<p>The novel’s protagonist, Richard Hannay, is an expatriate Scot who has just returned to London after many years in South Africa working in the mining industry. He finds England extremely dull and is just considering returning to South Africa when he is accosted by another inhabitant of the block of flats where he is living.</p>
			<p>This man, Scudder, tells Hannay he knows of a fantastical plot by England’s enemies to create a diplomatic scandal. Hannay, at first skeptical, eventually accepts that there is something in it and harbours Scudder in his own flat. Returning to his flat some days later, Hannay is horrified to find Scudder stabbed to death. Realising that he will be suspected by the police, and that he may also be in danger from the plotters, Hannay flees London.</p>
			<p>What follows is an exciting chase across Scotland, with Hannay frequently coming close to capture.</p>
			<p><i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> was immediately popular, particularly with troops in the trenches of the First World War. It has remained popular and has been used as the basis for several movies including one directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. It could also be seen as the prototype of several similarly-themed movies and television shows such as <i>The Fugitive</i>.</p>
			<p>John Buchan continued the adventures of Richard Hannay in a series of sequels. He also had a highly distinguished government and diplomatic career, ultimately becoming Governor General of Canada.</p>

		<summary type="text">A narrative tracing the ups and downs of a nouveau-riche upper-middle-class English family at the end of the Victorian era.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Between 1906 and 1921 John Galsworthy published three novels chronicling the Forsyte family, a fictional upper-middle class family at the end of the Victorian era: <i>The Man of Property</i>, <i>In Chancery</i>, and <i>To Let</i>. In 1922 Galsworthy wrote two interconnecting short stories to bind the three novels together and published the whole as <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>.</p>
			<p>While the novels follow the Forsyte family at large, the action centers around Soames Forsyte⁠—the scion of a nouveau-riche London tea merchant—his wife Irene, and their unhappy marriage. Soames and his sprawling family are portrayed as stereotypes of unhappy gilded-age wealth, their family having entered the industrial revolution poor farmers and emerged as wealthy bourgeoise. Their rise was powered by their capacity to acquire, won at the expense of their capacity for almost anything else.</p>
			<p>Thematically, the saga focuses on the mores of the wealthy upper-middle class, which was still a newish feature in the class landscape of England at the time; duty, honor, and love; and the rapidly growing differences across generations occurring in a period of war and social change. The characters are complex and nuanced, and the situations they find themselves in—both of their own making, and of the making of society around them—provide a rich field for analyzing the close of the Victorian age, the dawn of the Edwardian age, and the societal frameworks that were forged in that frisson.</p>
			<p>Galsworthy went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932 for <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>, one of the rare occasions in which the Swedish Academy has awarded a prize for a specific work instead of for a lifetime of work.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of John Keats’ published poems, and a selection of unpublished fragments and posthumous verse.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>John Keats’ poems are a major part of the second wave of English Romantic poetry. They portray settings loaded with symbolism and sensuality, and draw heavily on Greek and Roman myth along with romanticised tales of chivalry. Keats died in 1821 at the young age of 25, having written the majority of his work in less than four years. While not appreciated during his lifetime, he has gone on to become one of the most loved of the Romantic poets, and has provided inspiration to authors as diverse as Oscar Wilde, Wilfred Owen and Neil Gaiman.</p>
			<p>This collection includes among others early work such as “On Death,” the six odes written in 1819, his two epics <i>Hyperion</i> and <i>Endymion</i>, and “To Autumn,” now widely considered to be one of the best English short poems. Keats’ works are presented here in chronological order, and include the poems published in his lifetime and other unfinished fragments and posthumous verse.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adventure tale of smuggling, treasure and shipwreck.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Moonfleet is a small village near the sea in the south of England, where village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John “Blackbeard” Mohune who is buried in a family crypt under the church. He is said to have stolen and hidden a diamond from King Charles I. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for the diamond, and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities.</p>
			<p>One night a bad storm floods the village. While attending the Sunday service at church, John Trenchard—an orphan who lives with his aunt—hears strange sounds from the crypt below. Investigating, he soon finds himself in a smuggler’s hideout, where he discovers a locket in a coffin that holds a piece of paper inscribed with Bible verses.</p>
			<p>John soon finds himself swept up in a smuggling venture planned by Elzevir Block, the smugglers’ leader, and inadvertently finds out that the verses from Blackbeard’s locket contain a code that will reveal the location of the famous diamond.</p>
			<p><i>Moonfleet</i> was hugely popular in its day and was even sometimes studied in schools. Adaptations to screen, radio, and theater continue today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A dramatic imagining in blank verse of the rebellion of Satan against God, Satan’s overthrow, and the Fall of Man.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Paradise Lost</i> is an epic poem written by the Puritan English poet John Milton between 1658 and 1663, and published in 1667. This is a period of English history which encompasses the end of Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.</p>
			<p>Perhaps reflecting some of his country’s turmoil during Milton’s life, <i>Paradise Lost</i> deals with revolution in Heaven by Satan and his followers against God, their defeat and banishment to Hell, and their subsequent plotting of revenge, leading ultimately to Satan beguiling Eve in Paradise to taste the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge against the explicit command of God. Milton’s vivid and poetic description of these events is both dramatic and compelling. The work gained swift acceptance and has always remained a popular and important part of English literature.</p>
			<p>Originally published in ten books, a second edition was published in 1674 arranged into twelve books, the form in which it appears here. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on a 1910 edition edited by A. W. Verity.</p>

		<summary type="text">The influential Scottish-American naturalist spends a summer exploring the high country surrounding the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, and records what he sees in a diary.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the summer of 1869, Scottish-American naturalist and author John Muir spent the months of June through September in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California accompanying a group of shepherds while they led a flock of sheep to the high country to graze. During that time, Muir took every opportunity to explore the Yosemite area extensively—hiking, camping, writing, and sketching. Muir’s diary entries describing the land, flora, and fauna he encountered became the basis for the book <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, first published in 1911.</p>
			<p>Muir’s journal entries from that summer reveal his growing wonder and awe at the Yosemite landscape, as well as his endless curiosity for the natural world. On a grand scale, he trekked into remote areas for sometimes days at a time. He climbed Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana and trekked through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake. On a more modest scale, Muir observed the flora and fauna that surrounded him with the keen enthusiasm of a naturalist. He described in detail the area’s trees, shrubs, flowers, mountain meadows, glacial features, and animals.</p>
			<p>In the years that followed the publication of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, Muir went on to advocate for the protection and preservation of wild landscapes. In 1892, Muir co-founded the Sierra Club and became the organization’s first president. Muir also played an instrumental role in the establishment of several national parks including Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon.</p>
			<p><i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> remains among John Muir’s most popular works. The book’s inspired and lyrical accounts of an iconic wilderness, written at a time in Muir’s life when his character as a naturalist and wilderness advocate was taking form, earns it a prominent, influential place in the annals of nature writing and the history of wilderness preservation.</p>

		<summary type="text">Journalist John Reed gives a first-hand account of Russia’s 1917 October Revolution, which lead to the formation of the Soviet Union.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1917 John Reed, a journalist and socialist, witnessed first-hand the 1917 Russian October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks seized power and began forming the Soviet Union. <i>Ten Days that Shook the World</i> is his account of the revolution, including on-the-ground descriptions of the days up to those portentious events.</p>
			<p>The book received a mixed reception. Some reviewers found it a powerful account of the events, one of the few available in English. Others noted Reed’s bias as an established Socialist writer. In any case, the book was hugely influential: this edition boasts a preface by Lenin, John Reed was buried in Moscow in a site reserved for Soviet leadership, and some Soviet couples even went so far as to name their children “Johnreed.” In 1999 New York University placed <i>Ten Days that Shook the World</i> 7th in their “Top 100 Works of Journalism” list.</p>

		<summary type="text">Mill’s famous essay that applies a utilitarian ethical system to systems of government.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>John Stuart Mill was a prolific and well-regarded author and philosopher in his day, but perhaps his most enduring work is <i>On Liberty</i>, an essay developed over several years and with significant input from his wife. In it, he applies his views on the Utilitarian ethical theory to systems of society and governance. The result became one of the most influential essays on liberal political thought in modern history.</p>
			<p>In <i>On Liberty</i> Mill addresses such familiar concepts as freedom of speech, the importance of individuality, and the limits of society’s influence on the individual. He caps the discussion with an application of these principles to problems of the day, including education and the economy.</p>

		<summary type="text">An Englishman travels to fictional islands where he meets tiny people, giants, magicians and talking horses.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> was published in 1726 and is probably the most famous work by Jonathan Swift. It was an instant hit—selling out within a week—and has never been out of print, as well as having been adapted many times.</p>
			<p>Lemuel Gulliver, an English surgeon on the <i>Antelope</i>, is shipwrecked and washed up on the island of Lilliput, where the inhabitants are less than six inches tall. This part of the book is a thinly veiled attack on the political classes of the time, as the Lilliputians focus on the minutiae of life, most notably the rift which has developed according to which end of a boiled egg gets opened at breakfast—the big end or the little end.</p>
			<p>On his second recorded journey he is abandoned on an island of giants where he is paraded as a curiosity at local markets and fairs. On his third journey he is marooned by pirates and is rescued by the inhabitants of a floating island devoted to music, mathematics and astronomy. On his final journey he meets the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses who have subdued the Yahoos, creatures who resemble humans.</p>
			<p>On his return to England, Gulliver has a very different outlook on life and views the human race in a very different way.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Originally published serially as a three-part story, <i>Heart of Darkness</i> is a short but thematically complex novel exploring colonialism, humanity, and what constitutes a savage society. Set in the Congo in Central Africa, the tale is told in the frame of the recollections of one Charles Marlow, a captain of an ivory steamer. Marlow’s search for the mysterious and powerful “first-class agent” Kurtz gives way to a nuanced and powerful commentary on the horrors of colonialism, called by some the most analyzed work at university-level instruction.</p>

		<summary type="text">The fictitious South American republic of Costaguana is in the midst of a civil war and the citizens of the coastal town of Sulaco turn to Nostromo for help.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Originally published as a serial, <i>Nostromo</i> is set in a fictional South American country where the outbreak of civil war puts the mining town of Sulaco in turmoil. Giovanni Battista Fidanza, known as Nostromo, is given the task of smuggling out a large amount of silver to keep it from the revolutionaries.</p>
			<p>Conrad was inspired to write the book when he read, in a sailor’s memoir, the tale of a man who singlehandedly stole a boatload of silver. He had first heard the same story a quarter of a century earlier as a young sailor.</p>
			<p><i>Nostromo</i> has met with critical acclaim: it is often regarded as Conrad’s greatest novel and Francis Scott Fitzgerald said he would rather have written <i>Nostromo</i> than any other novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">A spy in London is ordered to stage a bombing to foment political and social chaos.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The place is London, and the time is the late 1800s. Mr. Verloc appears to be an unassuming owner of a bric-a-brac store, but he’s actually a spy for an unnamed country. When he’s summoned by his superiors and ordered to plant a bomb to foment unrest in English politics and society, he finds himself stuck in a more-than-uncomfortable situation.</p>
			<p>Conrad’s novel is set against the background of the Greenwich Observatory bombing, in which an anarchist unsuccessfully tried to detonate a bomb near the building. Terrorist activity was on the rise, and Conrad uses the fear and uncertainty of the time to explore the meanings of duty and of evil, along with the influence politics and political movements have on terrorist violence.</p>
			<p><i>The Secret Agent</i> is widely considered one of Conrad’s finest novels, with modern critics praising its prescient forecast of 20th century politics and society.</p>

		<summary type="text">A minor government official travels the Australian outback and talks to a variety of characters such as bullock-team drivers and swagmen along the way.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Such is Life</i> is an Australian novel written by Joseph Furphy under a pseudonym of “Tom Collins” and published in 1903. It purports to be a series of diary entries by the author, selected at approximately one-month intervals during late 1883 and early 1884. “Tom Collins” travels rural New South Wales and Victoria, interacting and talking at length with a variety of characters including the drivers of bullock-teams, itinerant swagmen, boundary riders, and squatters (the owners of large rural properties). The novel is full of entertaining and sometimes melancholy incidents mixed with the philosophical ramblings of the author and his frequent quotations from Shakespeare and poetry. Its depictions of the Australian bush, the rural lifestyle, and the depredations of drought are vivid.</p>
			<p>Furphy is sometimes called the “Father of the Australian Novel,” and <i>Such is Life</i> is considered a classic of Australian literature.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Jules Verne’s most-acclaimed novel remains a cultural cornerstone to this day. The story of Phileas Fogg’s spectacular journey by then-novel technologies is a fast-paced, colorful, and thoroughly enjoyable portrait of the British empire at the height of its power.</p>
			<p>Originally published as a serial so believable that readers at the time placed bets on whether Fogg would succeed or not, Verne’s adventure epic continues to inspire travelers and adventurers to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">Five Americans, balloon-wrecked on a deserted island, must find a way to survive while revealing the island’s strange mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mysterious Island</i> tells the tale of five Americans who, in an attempt to escape the Civil War, pilot a hot-air balloon and find themselves crashed on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. Verne had been greatly influenced by works like <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, and that influence shines brightly in this novel of engineering ingenuity and adventure. Verne imparts the escapees with such over-the-top cleverness and so many luckily-placed resources that modern readers might find the extent to which they tame the island comical. Despite that, the island contains genuine mysteries for the adventurers to solve.</p>
			<p>The standard translation of <i>The Mysterious Island</i> was produced in 1875, and is credited to W. H. G. Kingston. Despite its popularity, it’s widely criticized for abridiging and Bowlderizing important parts of the text. The translation presented here, produced by Stephen W. White in 1876, is considered a much more accurate translation, despite it also abridging some portions.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tale of oceanic adventure in the famous submersible Nautilus.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A seminal tale of science fiction, <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas</i> is one of Jules Verne’s most famous novels. It’s more than just a stirring adventure tale—it’s also one of Verne’s most scientifically-accurate and prescient works, predicting amazing advances in electricity, undersea travel, and technology.</p>
			<p>In it we follow Professor Aronnax, a French marine biologist, as he and his companions, Conseil and Ned Land, become prisoners (guests?) aboard the <i>Nautilus</i>, captained by the mysterious and tortured Captain Nemo. Their adventures, including encounters with island-locked natives, battles with giant sea squids, and undersea shark hunting, have become iconic parts of modern culture.</p>
			<p>This translation was produced and dedicated to the public domain in 1991 by F. P. Walter, making it an extremely rare treasure: a high-quality modern translation free from any intellectual monopoly restrictions.</p>

		<summary type="text">Julius Caesar’s account of the conflicts between Rome and Gaul in the later years of the Roman republic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Commentaries on the Gallic War</i> describes the conflicts between Rome and the region of Gaul in western Europe, as well as the Germanic peoples who lived to the east of the river Rhine, and Britain to the north, in the later years of the Roman republic.</p>
			<p>Despite being written in the 3rd person, the commentaries are the memoirs of Julius Caesar himself, and offer a unique insight into these events.</p>
			<p>Before the Gallic war began, the Romans had already conquered the region known as Provincia Nostra (literally: “our province”), which is now Languedoc and Provence in the south of France.</p>
			<p>Julius Caesar had been one of the two consuls elected in the year 59 BC. The consuls held the highest political office in the Roman republic, but their terms only lasted a year. When his consulship came to an end, Caesar retained power through the position of proconsul, governing Provincia Nostra and two other provinces. This provided Caesar with the necessary command to conduct the military campaigns in Gaul.</p>
			<p>Caesar’s victories in Gaul had huge repercussions on the future of Rome: the related work, <i>Commentaries on the Civil War</i>, documents the ensuing conflict between Caesar and Pompey that ultimately led to the end of the Roman republic and the beginning of the Roman empire.</p>

		<summary type="text">Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ classic analysis of modern industrial society and call for Working Class revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Perhaps the most influential and widely read political work of the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ <i>The Manifesto of the Communist Party</i> succinctly lays out the political theory and history of class struggle.</p>
			<p>Following a short introduction, the <i>Manifesto</i> develops over four short chapters, discussing the historical background of class struggle, the relationship of Communists with other socialist and working class movements, a critical review of other contemporary socialist literature and thinking, and finally a brief summary of the Communist position related to the contemporary political situations in various European countries, concluding with the rousing call-to-arms, “Workingmen of all countries unite!”</p>
			<p>This edition, translated by Samuel Moore, includes Engels’ own Preface and footnote annotations written for the English edition of 1888.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Kate Chopin’s short stories, ordered by date of writing.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Kate Chopin’s most famous work nowadays is the novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin/the-awakening"><i>The Awakening</i></a>, but at the turn of the last century she was more famous for her short fiction, published in American magazines like the <i><abbr>St.</abbr> Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, <i>Youth’s Companion</i>, and <i>Vogue</i>. A prolific writer, over the course of fourteen years she penned nearly a hundred stories, although many didn’t see publication until a new collection was released in 1963. The stories focus on life in 1890s Louisiana, a setting that she was living in as a resident of New Orleans and Natchitoches. They’re told from many different points of view, but always with empathy for the struggles, both big and small, of the protagonists.</p>
			<p>This collection contains the forty-nine short stories of Kate Chopin verified to be in the US public domain, including “Désirée’s Baby” and “The Dream of an Hour.” They’re presented in the order they were originally written.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman’s dawning realisation of her situation leads to a struggle for independence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Awakening</i> charts Edna Pontellier’s journey of self-discovery. The time spent with a younger friend on a summer holiday on Grand Isle in Lousiana unlocks a feeling in her that she can’t close away again. On returning to her family home in New Orleans, she starts to transition from unthinking housewife and mother into something freer and more confident, although this doesn’t meet with the full approval of the society she’s a part of.</p>
			<p>Kate Chopin had written a novel previously, but she was mostly known as a writer of Louisiana-set short stories. <i>The Awakening</i>, while keeping the setting, charted new territory with its themes of marital infidelity and less-than-perfect devotion of a mother to her children. The consequent critical reception was less than enthusiastic⁠—hardly surprising given the prevailing moral atmosphere of the time⁠—and her next novel was cancelled. <i>The Awakening</i> was rediscovered in the 1960s and is now regarded as an important early example of American feminist literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their Kansas home by a cyclone.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> is the classic American children’s novel about the adventures of Dorothy, a young girl who along with her dog Toto is swept away by a cyclone to the magical Land of Oz. It was written by L. Frank Baum and published in May 1900.</p>
			<p>Dorothy lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and Toto on a farm in the Kansas prairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a cyclone that deposits her farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical Silver Shoes that once belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home is to go to the Emerald City and ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her.</p>
			<p>The Library of Congress has declared it “America’s greatest and best-loved homegrown fairy-tale.” Its groundbreaking success and the success of the Broadway musical adaptation led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books which serve as sequels to the first story. The 1939 film musical adaptation starring Judy Garland is considered by many to be one of the greatest films in cinema history.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the fundamental texts of the Tao philosophy and religion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is a classic Chinese text written around the 6th century BC by Laozi, a Zhou-dynasty courtier. While its authorship is debated, the text remains a fundamental building block of Taoism and one of the most influential works of its time. Today it’s one of the most-translated works in the world.</p>
			<p>The work itself is a series of 81 short poetic sections, each one written in a fluid, ambiguous style, leaving them open to wide interpretation. Subjects range from advice to those in power to advice to regular people and adages for daily living. Because of its ambiguous nature the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is famously difficult to translate, and many, if not all, translations are significantly influenced by the translator’s state of mind. This translation is by James Legge, a famous Scottish sinologist and the first professor of Chinese at Oxford University.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man describes his birth and upbringing through the adventures of his family.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</i>, a fictional autobiography of the eponymous narrator, contains—perhaps surprisingly—little about either his life or opinions, but what it does have is a meandering journey through the adventures of his close family and their associates. The book is famous for being more about the explanatory diversions and rabbit-holes that the narrator takes us down than the actual happenings he set out to describe, but in doing so he paints a vivid picture of the players and their personal stories.</p>
			<p>Published two volumes at a time over the course of eight years, <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was an immediate commercial success although not without some confusion among critics. Sterne’s exploration of form that pushed at the contemporary limits of what could be called a novel has been hugely influential, garnering admirers as varied as Marx, Schopenhauer, Joyce, Woolfe and Rushdie. The book has been translated into many other languages and adapted for the stage, radio, and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">A brief meditation on depression, philosophy, religion, and the meaning of life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Leo Tolstoy wrote this short meditation on sadness and the meaning of life when he was middle aged. He had already completed his masterworks, <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>War and Peace</i>, reared fourteen children, and gained fame and acclaim in Russia as a man of letters. But despite having attained that success, he still found himself unhappy and always returning to the disturbing idea that all achievement is meaningless.</p>
			<p><i>A Confession</i> is his attempt to put these thoughts in words as he teetered on the brink of suicide. It forms the first in a four-volume series that included <i>A Criticism of Dogmatic Theology</i>, <i>The Gospel in Brief</i>, and <i>What I Believe</i> (also known as <i>My Religion</i> or <i>My Faith</i>).</p>

		<summary type="text">Tolstoy describes true Christianity as a non-hierarchical, nonviolent, non-coercive pursuit, and criticizes institutional Christianity as a deceptive corruption.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i> is the most influential work of Christian anarchism. It might be considered the founding work of that tradition if it didn’t itself claim to merely be pointing out Christian anarchism as the plain meaning of the gospels.</p>
			<p>Tolstoy argues that institutional Christianity with its doctrines, church hierarchies, and ritual practices, is anti-Christian. Christ, he says, explicitly told his followers to reject doctrines, church institutions and hierarchies, and ritual practices, and instead to love truth, to honor God, and to treat all people as your family and as you would want to be treated.</p>
			<p>Tolstoy says that a Christian cannot participate in the political system, which is based on the use of violence to enforce the separation of people and the privileging of some people over others, and at the same time follow Jesus in his command to love your neighbor.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Leonid Andreyev’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Leonid Andreyev was a Russian playwright and author of short stories and novellas, writing primarily in the first two decades of the 20th century. Matching the depression he suffered from an early age, his writing is always dark of tone with subjects including biblical parables, Russian life, eldritch horror and revolutionary fervour. <abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft was a reader of his work, and <i>The Seven Who Were Hanged</i> (included here) has even been cited as direct inspiration for the assassination of Arch-Duke Ferdinand: the event that started the first World War. Originally a lawyer, his first published short story brought him to the attention of Maxim Gorky who not only became a firm friend but also championed Andreyev’s writing in his collections to great commercial acclaim.</p>
			<p>Widely translated into English during his life, this collection comprises the best individual translations of each of his short stories and novellas available in the public domain, presented in chronological order of their original publication in Russian.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl follows a white rabbit into a strange land of poetry, humor, and whimsy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Everyone’s familiar with Lewis Carroll’s famous children’s classic and the huge influence it’s had on modern culture. The Mad Hatter, the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar—all of these strange and familiar creatures appear in <i>Alice</i>, and the nonsensical style, memorable poems, and colorful set pieces are just as influential.</p>
			<p>The book was originally written as gift to Alice Liddel, the daughter of one of Carroll’s friends. Carroll had told the story to Alice during a rainy-day boat trip up a river. It stuck in his mind, and a few years later the completed manuscript was published in 1865. More than 150 years later, it’s just as popular as it ever was.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of fantastical short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Book of Wonder</i> is one of Lord Dunsany’s many collections of fantasy short stories. While many of his collections were illustrated, this particular one is different—the illustrations were completed <em>first</em>. Dunsany then used the illustrations as inspirations for the stories around them.</p>
			<p>This collection features fourteen short stories, all of them whimsical, imaginative, and deeply strange. Dunsany writes stories that don’t always have a happy ending, and these are no exception—though they’re written in an almost fairytale or allegorical style, they each have a melancholy, vengeful, or even mad edge to them.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious god creates a cosmic pantheon to rule over its worlds and time.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Gods of Pegāna</i>, Lord Dunsany’s first published book, is a strange and wonderous creation. In it he creates the pantheon of gods who rule over the titular world. The prose alternates between being biblical, high-minded, and childish, with the gods frustrating their human subjects through their single-minded and often completely inscrutible actions. When they’re not busy being mysterious, they’re busy taking revenge on each other.</p>
			<p>It’s possible these short tales were written to convey lessons about life, death, and the nature of belief, though the rhythmic simplicity of the prose and the strange and often petty nature of the gods leaves that up to debate. Regardless, <i>The Gods of Pegāna</i> is a fascinating and influential read.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of how four young sisters grow to adulthood.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Little Women</i> is the classic coming-of-age tale of four sisters on their journey to adulthood. Though today it’s considered a classic, <i>Little Women</i> almost wasn’t written: Alcott wanted to publish a collection of short stories instead, but her publisher and her father pressed her to write a book that would appeal to a wide audience of young girls.</p>
			<p>The first volume was written quickly and published in 1868; it was a huge success, and Alcott composed volume 2 just as quickly and published it in 1869. By her own account she didn’t enjoy writing them, and both she and her publisher agreed the first few chapters were dull—it almost goes without saying they were pleasantly shocked at the positive reception the volumes received.</p>
			<p>By 1927 it had been acknowledged as one of the most widely-read novels of the era, and remains widely read today.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the most important texts of 20th century philosophy, in which the nature of the philosphy, language, understanding, and logical atomism are explored.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein is considered by many to be one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. He was born in Vienna to an incredibly rich family, but he gave away his inheritance and spent his life alternating between academia and various other roles, including serving as an officer during World War I and a hospital porter during World War II. When in academia Wittgenstein was taught by Bertrand Russell, and he himself taught at Cambridge.</p>
			<p>He began laying the groundwork for <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> while in the trenches, and published it after the end of the war. It has since come to be considered one of the most important works of 20th century philosophy. After publishing it, Wittgenstein concluded that it had solved all philosophical problems—so he never published another book-length work in his lifetime.</p>
			<p>The book itself is divided into a series of short, self-evident statements, followed by sub-statements elucidating on their parent statement, sub-sub-statements, and so on. These statements explore the nature of philosophy, our understanding of the world around us, and how language fits in to it all. These views later came to be known as “Logical Atomism.”</p>
			<p>This translation, while credited to C. K. Ogden, is actually mostly the work of F. P. Ramsey, one of Ogden’s students. Ramsey completed the translation when he was just 19 years of age. The translation was personally revised and approved by Wittgenstein himself, who, though he was Austrian, had spent much of his life in England.</p>
			<p>Much of the <i>Tractatus</i>’ meaning is complex and difficult to unpack. It is still being interpreted and explored to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">An absurdist comedy that contrasts illusion with reality, in which six characters arrive on a rehearsal stage filled with actors and demand the chance to speak their lines and act out the story of their lives.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i> (<i>Sei personaggi in cerca d’autore</i>) is an Italian three-act play written by Luigi Pirandello in 1921, considered as one of the earliest examples of absurdist theatre. It’s a play within a play that deals with perceptions of reality and illusion, and plays with the ideas of identity and relative truths.</p>
			<p>The plot features an acting company who have gathered to rehearse another play by Pirandello, when they’re interrupted by 6 “characters” who arrive in search of their author. They immediately clash with the manager who at first assumes they’re mad. But, as the play progresses, the manager slowly shifts his reality as the characters become more real than the actors.</p>
			<p><i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i> opened in Rome at Valle di Roma and created a huge and clamorous division in the audience, forcing Pirandello to escape out the side door. But a year later it was presented in Milan to great success, before moving on to Broadway in 1922 where it ran for 136 performances.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four witty and biting biographies of Victorians that take aim at the moral superiority of their subject’s time.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Eminent Victorians</i> consists of four short biographies by Lytton Strachey of Victorians who were famous in their day: Cardinal Manning, a powerful cleric; Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing; Thomas Arnold, founder of the modern-day English public school style; and General Gordon, a popular officer of the British Army.</p>
			<p>In Strachey’s day, these people were considered heroes and paragons of Victorian morality and ethics. But instead of lengthy, glowing biographies, Strachey opts for short, witty, and biting biographies that skewer their subjects. All of the subjects are portrayed with their human flaws and moral contradictions on full display, implicitly knocking down the sanctimonious visions of these former heroes (perhaps with the exception of Nightingale, who, while portrayed as an often-cold and mercilessly-driven taskmistress, nevertheless escaped with her reputation enhanced).</p>
			<p>The biographies are not only interesting for their wit, humor, and readability, but because of the windows they open to the issues of the age. Manning’s biography occurs against the backdrop of a time of upheaval in the English Catholic church, with concepts like Papal Infallability entering the picture; Nightingale’s biography shines light on the appalling conditions of war; Arnold’s biography is a lens on the development of formal education and schools; and Gordon’s biography reveals England as an empire growing more unsteady, whose ability to influence and control faraway lands is not as certain as it might think.</p>
			<p><i>Eminent Victorians</i> took six years to write and was met with glowing reviews on its publication. It made Strachey famous and cemented his name in the list of top-tier biographers.</p>

		<summary type="text">When his friend disappears suddenly in mysterious circumstances, a young, idle barrister feels forced to investigate, even at the peril of destroying the happiness of his beloved uncle.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was the most successful of a long series of novels written by Mary Elizabeth Braddon in what was then called the “sensation” genre because of the inventive and slightly scandalous plots of such works.</p>
			<p>Published in 1862, <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was immediately popular and is said to have made a fortune for its author. It has never been out of print and has been the basis for a number of dramas and movies.</p>
			<p>The novel begins with the return from the Australian goldfields of ex-dragoon George Talboys. Three years earlier, in the depths of poverty, he had abandoned his young wife and their baby in order to seek his fortune. He returns to England having made that fortune by finding a huge gold nugget. He enlists the help of his friend Robert Audley, a rather idle young barrister, to seek out his wife. To George’s dismay and overwhelming grief, however, he sees a newspaper notice of the death of his wife only a few days prior to his return.</p>
			<p>A year later, when visiting Audley’s relatives and after catching a glimpse of the pretty new wife of Robert’s uncle, George goes missing. Robert becomes increasingly convinced that his friend has met with violence and is dead, and begins to investigate. What he discovers fills him with despair.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of science fiction short stories by Mack Reynolds ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Dallas McCord “Mack” Reynolds was an American science fiction writer who authored almost two hundred short stories and novellas, was a staple in all the major science fiction and fantasy magazines and published dozens of science fiction novels. He began his writing career in the late 1940s. His fiction focused on exploring and challenging both the socioeconomic themes of the day and the implications of the Cold War that raged throughout his career. A thoughtful writer of speculative fiction, many of Mack Reynolds’ predictions have come to pass, including the credit-card economy, remote warfare and a worldwide computer network. His thoughts about the outcomes of both the Soviet and western political and economic systems are still highly relevant.</p>
			<p>This collection gathers 21 of his stories that were published between 1953 and 1963 in <i>Analog</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i> and others. Ordered by date of first publication, they range from spy adventures to the ultimate expression of corporate warfare and from a very short 1000-word story to full-blown novellas.</p>

		<summary type="text">The personal diary of the Roman Emperor, in which he lays out his thoughts and philosophical musings on the Stoic philosophy and way of life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus was the model of what we call a philosopher-king. Though his rule was troubled by war and conflict, he remained a thoughtful and even-handed ruler.</p>
			<p><i>Meditations</i> isn’t a complete book, but rather a collection of his personal diary entries written over a ten-year campaign in Greece. The entries were never meant to be published; instead, they were a reminder to himself of how to remain calm, tranquil, and kind, even in the worst of situations. In them we see the emperor working out how to deal with the everyday problems all of us face: annoying coworkers, difficult family members, the expectations of others, unrealized goals and achievements, and, ultimately, happiness.</p>
			<p>The episodic nature of <i>Meditations</i> makes it hard to follow at times, but in exchange we get a deeply personal window into the life of one of Rome’s most unique emperors, and more importantly, a handbook of thoughtful advice on how to live a tranquil, satisfied, and productive life.</p>

		<summary type="text">An engineer from 19th-century Connecticut is sent back in time to King Arthur’s medieval England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</i> is one of Mark Twain’s most enduring novels. During a stay at a modern-day English castle, the narrator meets a mysterious stranger. The stranger, Hank Morgan, is an engineer from Connecticut, and proceeds to weave a satirical, biting, and hilarious tale of how he traveled back in time to find himself in the court of the legendary King Arthur. There he uses his modern-day knowledge to convince the locals that he’s a powerful magician. As the book progresses, Hank modernizes—and Americanizes—the lives of the locals.</p>
			<p>Twain’s talent for humor and satire are on full display in <i>Yankee</i>, and he doesn’t waste the opportunity to use Hank as a mouthpiece for his views on things like politics, capitalism, and justice. Many consider it to be his best work.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a young boy and his friend, an escaped slave, on the Mississippi river in the Antebellum South.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>One of the great American novels, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> tells the story of Huck Finn and his travels with Jim, an escaped slave. Roundly criticised by contemporary reviewers for its colorful and literal language and even banned by several libraries, it sealed its historical importance in part by being one of the first novels to be written entirely in American vernacular.</p>
			<p>While <i>Huck Finn</i> is, on its face, an adventure tale for younger readers, it’s also a cutting satire and a nuanced examination of racism and morality. Hemingway called it “the best book we’ve had.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A young boy growing up in Missouri gets into all sorts of trouble and, with his friend, stumbles on a treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The irrepressible Tom Sawyer drives his Aunt Polly to distraction; she can’t decide whether to cry or laugh at his antics. He fights, falls in love, and finds adventure with two of his friends, one of whom will later become famous in his own right. Along the way he attends his own funeral, wins the girl by falsely confessing to something she did, and, most famously, convinces most of the boys in town to pay him for the privilege of painting his aunt’s fence.</p>
			<p><i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was Mark Twain’s first novel written solely by himself. Although he was already a well-known author, it was for autobiographical sketches (<i>The Innocents Abroad</i>) and novels written with others (<i>The Gilded Age</i>). In writing about Tom, Twain drew on his childhood growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, infusing the story with his usual biting satire and social commentary. In Tom Sawyer and his friends, Twain created young men who would long outlive him. Not without controversy over the years due to its language and negative depiction of a Native American, <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is arguably Twain’s most endearing, and enduring, work.</p>

		<summary type="text">The Prince of England and a pauper find their identities switched.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> remains one of Twain’s more popular novels, having been adapted many times for the stage, screen, and elsewhere. When Tom Canty, a young pauper in London, meets Prince Edward, the two switch clothes and assume the other’s identity. Tom then learns the life of royalty, while the true prince discovers the troubles of commoners.</p>
			<p>As usual, Twain delivers both humor and social commentary in abundance. Although aimed at children, <i>Pauper</i> provides moral and social criticism of topics like the justice system and inequality, and deals with themes which appeal to readers of all ages.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tragic scientist creates a monster in his laboratory.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mary Shelley (then Godwin) and Percy Bysshe Shelley were visiting their friend Lord Byron in Geneva one rainy summer. With the weather against them, they decided to spend their time writing ghost stories for each other. <i>Frankenstein</i> is Mary Shelley’s submission to their contest, later published anonymously in 1818.</p>
			<p>Victor Frankenstein, a strange but brilliant scientist, discovers a method of imparting life to inanimate matter. The Monster is thus born: a hideous, 8-foot-tall creature of muscle, speed, and intellect. Frankenstein’s rejection of his appalling creation sends it into a spiral of despair, and Frankenstein’s life is never the same.</p>
			<p>Considered by many to be the first science fiction novel, <i>Frankenstein</i> is a powerful narrative that explores complex themes of belonging, morality, and the consequences of the power over life and death.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman-thief returns only to face his most dangerous opponent yet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Arsène Lupin disappeared at the end of <i>The Hollow Needle</i> the public and police assumed he was dead; but it turns out he was just biding his time and waiting for the right opponent to face off against. Luckily, a secret involving a stash of hidden papers and Europe’s aristocratic families is more than enough to pique the interests of Lupin and his unknown competitor. This novel is told more from Lupin’s point of view than the previous stories, and that reduces some of the omnipotence bestowed upon him by Leblanc while highlighting his more emotional qualities.</p>
			<p>Originally serialized in <i>Le Journal</i>, <i>813</i> was published in novel form in 1910. At more than 500 pages, it was deemed a little heavy and was subsequently split into two volumes in 1917 along with slight editing to increase the timely anti-German sentiment. Presented here is the 1910 English translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">The infamous French thief must pit his wits against England’s finest detective in the second Arsène Lupin collection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arsène Lupin takes on his most fearsome opponent yet in this second collection of his larcenous adventures. More a loving homage than a straight copy, Herlock Sholmes (changed just enough to avoid fallout from a copyright claim by Conan Doyle) and his companion Wilson are summoned to France initially to throw light on the case of the Blonde Lady. Having encountered Arsène Lupin before, Sholmes is only too happy to get a chance of revenge.</p>
			<p>This collection of two stories were originally serialised in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1906 to 1907, and were translated into English in 1910. After an earlier story with an unauthorised Sherlock Holmes, Maurice Leblanc was forced to rename his antagonist for these stories.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman-thief relates stories of his outwitting the Parisian detectives.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The gentleman-thief Arsène Lupin returns in this set of ten short stories to confess—or perhaps boast about—his crimes to the unnamed narrator. Mostly set around Lupin’s attempts to frustrate Chief-Inspector Ganimard and pocket some cash in the process, they also show off his knack for escaping from seemingly impossible situations, and even playing the role of the master detective.</p>
			<p>In the chronology of Arsène Lupin, these tales were published after, but set before, the darker stories of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/the-hollow-needle/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>The Hollow Needle</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/813/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>813</i></a>. They were serialised in <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1911, and collected into a single publication in 1913.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman thief scrambles to save the lives of two of his accomplices.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arsène Lupin’s attempted robbery of the deputy Daubrecq has gone horribly wrong, leaving behind a murdered man and two of his accomplices in the hands of the police. Now he finds himself pulled into an ever more conspiratorial spiral as he attempts to gain leverage over the people who can free his men. Set before the events of the preceding <i>813</i>, this again portrays Lupin in a much different light to the earlier books. At times almost coming to despair, this story shows him grappling with his personal morals whilst trying to do the best for those closest to him.</p>
			<p>The story was originally serialised in <i>Le Journal</i> in 1912, before being published as a novel in both the original French and this English translation by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in 1913.</p>

		<summary type="text">A prince enlists a lady to help him solve eight mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Trying to escape from her boring life, Hortense Daniel meets the mysterious Prince Rénine (or should we say Arsène Lupin?) who enlists her help to solve eight mysteries, starting with one that is for her very close to home. The pair’s travels take them across northern France as they help ease the path of true love, bring thieves and murderers to justice, and eventually to recover something very dear to Hortense’s heart.</p>
			<p><i>The Eight Strokes of the Clock</i> is an Arsène Lupin novel by any other name, with Maurice Leblanc admitting as much in an opening note. Set in the early days of the character’s history, this collection of mysteries has the hallmarks of classic Lupin: a fervent desire to impress, dazzling jumps of logic and an ambivalent belief that the law can provide justice. This English translation was published in 1922 in the same year it was being serialized in France; it was published in novel form there a year later.</p>

		<summary type="text">An infamous French thief plans intricate ways of stealing precious paintings and jewellery in this first collection of Arsène Lupin short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arsène Lupin, with his characteristic wit, plots over the course of nine short stories to steal many of France’s best antiques and artworks from under their owners’ noses. Only his classic opponent Detective Ganimard has the brilliance to attempt to foil Arsène’s plans, albeit with mixed results.</p>
			<p>This first collection of nine Arsène Lupin stories were originally serialised in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1905 and translated into English in 1910. The final story of the set features an unauthorised Sherlock Holmes whose appearance annoyed Arthur Conan-Doyle; the character’s name was changed to “Herlock Sholmes” for later stories. Arsène Lupin later went on to feature in over fifty stories by Maurice Leblanc along with many other books, films and plays around the world.</p>

			<p>Captain Belval, learning of a threat to his beloved nurse Little Mother Coralie, rescues her from her would-be assailants and is promptly dragged into a plot involving her husband and millions of francs worth of gold.

		<summary type="text">The famous gentleman-thief plans his most audacious crime yet: to steal the lost treasures of France.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this first full-length Arsène Lupin novel the gentleman-thief remains a shadowy figure for most of the novel, working two steps beyond the law with a hidden aim. To fight against this anti-hero, Leblanc introduces Isidore Beautrelet, the prodigious school-boy detective. Also making an appearance are old foes Detective Ganimard and (in yet another copyright-defeating name change) Holmlock Shears. The battle of wills that ensues pulls Isidore through rural France as he tries to get to the bottom of Lupin’s motives.</p>
			<p><i>The Hollow Needle</i> was originally serialized in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1908 to 1909, and was translated into English in 1910. Arsène Lupin starred in many further stories and plays, and a direct sequel to this story, <i xml:lang="fr">Le second visage d’Arsène Lupin</i>, was written by Pierre Boileau and Pierre Ayraud in 1975.</p>

		<summary type="text">After seeing her name in an unrelated film, a woman traces the clues that lead her to a terrifying secret.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>While watching a film, Véronique d’Hergemont spots her childhood signature mysteriously written on the side of a hut in the background of a scene. Her visit to the location of the film shoot deepens the mystery, but also provides further clues that point her towards long-lost relations and a great secret from ancient history: a secret that will require the services of a particular man to unravel.</p>
			<p><i>The Secret of Sarek</i> was published in the original French in 1919, and in this English translation in 1920. It was Maurice Leblanc’s first Arsène Lupin novel written after the Great War, and its impact on Leblanc is palpable: the novel has a much darker tone than earlier works, and even the famous cheery charm of Lupin is diluted. The result is a classic horror story, bringing a new dimension to the series.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young travelling circus owner discovers a clue to ancestral treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Dorothy, ropedancer and palmist, arrives at the Château de Roborey with her circus, she’s already observed strange excavations at the grounds. Fate reveals a familial connection and drags her and her motley crew of war orphans into a quest for long-lost ancestral treasure, but her new-found nemesis is always close on her trail.</p>
			<p>Maurice Leblanc, most famous for his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin/">Arsène Lupin</a> stories, here switches to a new protagonist, but fans of his other work will find her strangely recognisable. Indeed, the mystery presented here is later referenced in <i>The Countess of Cagliostro</i> as a puzzle that Lupin did not have time to solve. This book was originally serialised in <i>Le Journal</i> between January and March 1923, and was published in novel form both in French and in this English translation later in the year. It was also later adapted as a French-language made-for-TV movie in 1983.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of satirical essays ridiculing pretentiousness through imitation.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Works of Max Beerbohm</i> is a collection of satirical essays by Max Beerbohm. It was published in 1896 at The Bodley Head, his publisher John Lane contributing a detailed bibliography of the works of the author, then aged 24. Before their publication as a book, the essays had appeared in prominent literary periodicals such as <i>The Yellow Book</i> and <i>The Savoy</i>. Most of the essays were written while he was a student at Oxford, although he had left Merton College in 1894. By then he was already known as a caricaturist, parodist and essayist and well acquainted with the writers and artists connected with The Bodley Head, notably Aubrey Beardsley and Oscar Wilde.</p>
			<p>The essays can perhaps be best described as both elaborate parody and viscious satire. Beerbohm’s intimate knowledge of the social circles of the time and his penchant for pointed descriptions of character are always on display, dismantling the purported greatness that surrounds him.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful magician unsuspectingly casts her charms on quiet Oxford.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Max Beerbohm earned his fame as a caricaturist and essayist, and <i>Zuleika Dobson</i> is his only novel. Despite that, <i>Zuleika</i> has earned no small measure of fame, with the Modern Library ranking it 59th in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.” Beerbohm’s essays were famous for their sharp wit and humor, and <i>Zuleika</i> follows in that tradition—Beerbohm himself called the novel “the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative idea.”</p>
			<p>The novel follows Zuleika Dobson, a rather talentless woman of middling looks who nonetheless holds an almost mystical power of attraction over the men she comes in contact with. When she begins attending Oxford, she catches the eye of not just the Duke of Dorset, but of the entire male class.</p>
			<p><i>Zuleika</i> is both an easy comedy and a biting satire of Edwardian social mores and of the male-dominated Oxford student culture. Beerbohm also seems to forecast with eerie accuracy the cultural obsession with talentless celebrity that came to dominate the turn of the 21st century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mad knight-errant and his down-to-earth squire encounter adventure in the Spanish countryside.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Don Quixote</i> is a novel that doesn’t need much introduction. Not only is it widely considered the greatest Spanish literary work of all time, one of the greatest literary works in history, and a cornerstone of the Western literary canon, it’s also considered one of the first—if not <em>the</em> first—modern novels.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is believed to be the first ebook edition of <i>Don Quixote</i> to feature a full transcription of translator John Ormsby’s nearly 1,000 footnotes. Ormsby as an annotator deftly explains obscure passages, gives background on the life and times of 1600s Spain, references decisions from other contemporary translators, and doesn’t hold back from sharing his views on the genius—and flaws—of Cervantes’ greatest work. Additionally this edition corrects hundreds of transcription and typography errors present in the source transcription.</p>
			<p>The story is of the eponymous Don Quixote, a country noble who, in his old age, reads too many chivalric romances and goes mad. After convincing his grubby servant, Sancho Panza, to join him as his squire, he embarks on an absurd and comic quest to do good and right wrongs.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Don Quixote</i>’s two volumes are published as a single work, but their publication came ten years apart. Cervantes saw great success with the publication of his first volume, and appeared to have little desire to write a second volume until a different author wrote a spurious, inferior sequel. This kicked Cervantes into gear and he wrote volume two, a more serious and philosophical volume than the largely comic first volume.</p>
			<p>Despite being written in 1605 and translated in 1885, <i>Don Quixote</i> contains a surprising amount of slapstick laughs—even for the modern reader—and narrative devices still seen in today’s fiction, including meta-narratives, frame narratives, and metafiction. Many scenes (like Quixote’s attack on the windmills) and characters (like Sancho Panza and Lothario) are so famous that they’re ingrained in our collective culture.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman struggles against the intellectual confines of her rural Australian life in the late 19th Century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>My Brilliant Career</i> is a classic Australian work published in 1901 by Stella Miles Franklin, with an introduction by Henry Lawson. A thinly-veiled autobiographical novel, it paints a vivid and sometimes grim picture of rural Australian life in the late 19th Century.</p>
			<p>Sybylla Melvyn is the daughter of a man who falls into grinding poverty through inadvised speculation before becoming a hopeless drunk unable to make a living from a small dairy farm. Sybylla longs for the intellectual things in life such as books and music. She wants to become a writer and rebels against the constraints of her life. For a short period she is allowed to stay with her better-off relatives, and there she attracts the attentions of a handsome and rich neighbour, Harold Beecham. The course of true love, however, does not run smoothly for this very independent young woman.</p>
			<p>The author, like many other women writers of the time, adopted a version of her name which suggested that she was male in order to get published. Today, the Miles Franklin Award is Australia’s premier literary award, with a companion award, the Stella, open only to women authors.</p>
			<p><i>My Brilliant Career</i> was made into a well-regarded movie in 1979. Directed by Gillian Armstrong, it features Judy Davis as Sybylla and Sam Neil as Harry Beecham.</p>

		<summary type="text">Machiavelli’s classic treatise on how to tyrannize one’s subjects.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prince</i> is a book that was controversial before it had even been sent to the printer. Written in vernacular Italian instead of Latin, dedicated to a member of one of the most powerful Italian families of the day, and only printed after Machiavelli’s death, this treatise on how to tyrannize effectively was considered shocking even by his contemporaries. The discussion of its morality that continues to this day gives us the modern-day word <i>Machiavellian</i>.</p>
			<p>The book is organized into several sections, each one giving direction on the ruthless rule of principalities that Machiavelli based on both reading and personal experience. Despite its controversial nature, <i>The Prince</i> is often cited as one of the first examples of modern philosophical thought, and the “advice” contained within is still quoted as relevant today.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dead Souls</i> is Nikolai Gogol’s last novel, and follows the tale of Pavel Chichikov, a down-on-his-luck gentleman determined to improve his lot in life. The story charts his scheme to purchase dead souls—the titles of deceased serfs—from wealthy landowners.</p>
			<p>The novel’s satirical take on the state of Russian society at the time leads Chichikov into increasingly difficult circumstances, in his attempts to cheat the both the system and the cavalcade of townspeople he meets along the way.</p>
			<p>Originally planned as a trilogy, Gogol apparently only completed the first two parts, and destroyed the latter half of the second part before his death. The novel as it stands ends in mid sentence but is regarded as complete.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Gogol’s translated short stories and novellas ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Nikolai Gogol spent most of his literary career writing short stories, drawing inspiration from his childhood in Ukraine and his adult life in <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg. His stories are filled with larger than life yet relatable characters and perfectly described locations, and span many genres from historical epics to early horror and surrealism.</p>
			<p>His influence on Russian literature cannot be understated: Fyodor Dostoevsky is quoted as saying “We all come out from Gogol’s ‘Overcoat,’ ” (presented here as “The Mantle”) and mentioned him by name in <i>Crime and Punishment</i>; Mikhail Bulgakov stated that “no-one can compare with him,” and Vladimir Nabokov wrote a full biography. Many of the stories in this collection have been adapted for stage and film, including “The Nose” as an opera by Dmitri Shostakovich.</p>
			<p>Collected here are all of the public domain translations into English of Gogol’s short stories, in chronological order of the original Russian publication. They were translated by Claud Field, Isabel <abbr>F.</abbr> Hapgood, Vizetelly and Company, and George Tolstoy.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of O. Henry short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>William Sydney Porter, known to readers as O. Henry, was a true raconteur. As a draftsman, a bank teller, a newspaper writer, a fugitive from justice in Central America, and a writer living in New York City, he told stories at each stop and about each stop. His stories are known for their vivid characters who come to life, and sometimes death, in only a few pages. But the most famous characteristic of O. Henry’s stories are the famous “twist” endings, where the outcome comes as a surprise both to the characters and the readers. O. Henry’s work was widely recognized and lauded, so much so that a few years after his death an award was founded in his name to recognize the best American short story (now stories) of the year.</p>
			<p>This collection gathers all of his available short stories that are in the U.S. public domain. They were published in various popular magazines of the time, as well as in the Houston <i>Post</i>, where they were not attributed to him until many years after his death.</p>

		<summary type="text">The Book of Tea is a long essay exploring the relationship between teaism, taoism, and the aesthetics of Japanese culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Book of Tea</i>, one of the great English tea classics, is a long essay about the connection between teaism, Taoism, and the aesthetics of Japanese culture. It was written by Okakura Kakuzō in English and was published in the United States in 1906.</p>
			<p>The essay targets a Western audience and seeks to explain the importance of tea in Japanese culture, not just as a beverage, but as a form of art expressed in different aspects. After a brief introduction of the Western attitude towards tea, Okakura demystifies the admiration of the Japanese people for this green plant by presenting the different schools of tea, its connection to Zen philosophy, and how it has affected the arts. The famous tea ceremony and its rigid formalities are explained, together with the contributions of the great tea-masters.</p>
			<p><i>The Book of Tea</i> is considered by many to be one of the first books to introduce Eastern culture and philosophy to the Western world. This was possible due to Okakura’s early contact with the English language and Western thought, but also due to his later involvement in the Asian art division of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which he came to head in 1910.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three volumes of lyrical quatrains about the joys of living, the meaning of existence, and what it means to lead a happy life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Omar Khayyám was a medieval Iranian mathemetician, philosopher, scholar, and poet. He was thought to have composed over 1,000 <i>rubáiyát</i>, or quatrains, in his lifetime. Many different scholars have translated selections of Khayyám’s quatrains, but Edward FitzGerald’s translation remains the most beloved.</p>
			<p>FitzGerald’s translation is interesting in that it isn’t a <em>literal</em> translation—rather, FitzGerald took significant artistic license in his interpretation. Thus it’s tough to say if we should call this a translation of the <i>Rubáiyát</i>, or poems by FitzGerald based on or inspired by Khayyám’s quatrains.</p>
			<p>Whatever we call it, this translation is a bright and lyrical celebration of the joys and beauties of everyday life. FitzGerald’s work has remained popular for hundreds of years precisely because of its uplifting and wonderous quality.</p>
			<p>This ebook is based on the fifth edition, which is very similar to the fourth edition, the last edition to be published in FitzGerald’s lifetime. The fifth edition was published posthumously based on FitzGerald’s notes.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comedy skewering Victorian high society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> is Oscar Wilde’s most popular play today, enduring thanks to its easy humor, witty dialog, and clever satire. It was also one of his more successful plays, despite its first run being prematurely ended after only 86 performances. The main characters pretend to be other people in order to escape social obligations, with the resulting confusion of identities driving the plot and the humor behind it.</p>
			<p><i>Earnest</i> also holds the sad distinction of being Wilde’s last published play. A feud with an aristocrat whose son was Wilde’s lover led to a court case revealing Wilde as a homosexual—a crime in those days, and punishable by imprisonment with hard labor.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Victorian dandy turns to a life of debauchery after a magical portrait stops him from aging.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was first published as a serial in <i>Lippencott’s Monthly Magazine</i>, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without Wilde’s approval. Wilde soon expanded it and republished it as a novel, including a short preface justifying his art. Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, <i>Dorian Gray</i> today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives. Couched in Wilde’s trademark cutting wit, <i>Dorian Gray</i> is still being adapted today, with Dorian and his moldering portrait remaining cultural touchstones.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories featuring Jeeves and Wooster and the upperclass English life of the early 1900s.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Jeeves Stories</i> is a collection of humorous short stories by P. G. Wodehouse that feature the adventures of his most famous characters, Jeeves and Wooster. Wooster is a wealthy and idle young English gentleman of the interwar era. Jeeves is his extraordinarily competent valet whose name has since become synonymous with perfect service. The stories follow Wooster in his wanderings about London, around England, and across the Atlantic to New York, with Jeeves following in his wake and striving to keep his employer well-groomed and properly presented. Along the way Jeeves must somehow also manage to extricate Wooster and his friends from the various scrapes and follies they get themselves into.</p>
			<p>First published as early as 1915, the stories first appeared on both sides of the Atlantic in publications like <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>The Strand Magazine</i>. They were later collected into books or reworked into novels. Though only less than 50 of Wodehouse’s over 300 short stories feature Jeeves and Wooster, they remain his most enduring characters. They’ve been copied, imitated, and featured in countless interpretations and adaptations. A century later, these stories still are as amusing and entertaining as they were when they were first published.</p>

		<summary type="text">Stanley Ukridge ensnares the narrator in another one of his schemes: running a chicken farm in the English countryside.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>P. G. Wodehouse once described his writing as “musical comedy without music,” and <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> is one of the earliest examples of his trademark style. The narrator, Jeremy Garnet, is a mild-mannered author attempting to finish his next novel in peace and quiet. Enter Stanley Ukridge, a man brimming with endless schemes, who draws the narrator into his latest, “the idea of a lifetime”⁠—running a chicken farm.</p>
			<p>With little practical knowledge, yet boundless ambition, they move to a country house and put the plan into action. Along the way, Garnet falls headlong in love with a woman on the train, and becomes consumed with winning her heart, despite formidable obstacles.</p>
			<p>The original edition of <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> was published in the UK in 1906. This newer edition dates from 1921 and is described as “entirely rewritten by the author.” It is the first introduction in print of the character Ukridge, who would appear again in other short stories and novels by Wodehouse.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man abandons his dream of playing cricket at Cambridge because of financial trouble and goes to work for a London bank, where he’s joined by an unflappable friend.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mike Jackson is a rising cricket star who finds his dreams of studying and playing at Cambridge upset by news of his father’s financial troubles. He takes a job with the New Asiatic Bank in London. He arrives to find that his dapper and verbose young friend Psmith is also a new employee, and together they navigate early twentieth century office life, make the best of their position and squeeze in a little cricket from time to time.</p>
			<p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the twentieth century. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years.</p>
			<p><i>Psmith in the City</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Captain</i> magazine in 1908 and 1909 as <i>The New Fold</i> and is the sequel to <i>Mike</i>, an earlier novel by Wodehouse.</p>

		<summary type="text">Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves try their hand at matchmaking in upper-class England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i> is the second novel to feature P. G. Wodehouse’s popular Bertie Wooster and Jeeves characters. Bertie, a member of the English upper class and one of the “idle rich,” tries his best to arrange relationships between two pairs of his friends. Though he means well, Bertie’s bumbling attempts wind up doing more harm than good (as usual), leaving it to his valet, Jeeves, to see if he can sort things out.</p>
			<p>A smooth, easy, and often hilarious read, <i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i> is an excellent example of why Bertie Wooster and Jeeves have become such iconic literary figures.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Wodehouse’s school stories about the lives and adventures of schoolboys in the early 1900s.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>School Stories</i> is a collection of humorous short stories by P. G. Wodehouse that feature the trials, tribulations and adventures of the denizens of the turn-of-the-century English boarding school.</p>
			<p>First published in schoolboy magazines starting in 1901, the stories originally appeared in publications like <i>The Captain</i> and <i>Public School Magazine</i>. Some were also later collected into books. These stories, written more than a decade before he moved on to his more famous characters like Jeeves and Wooster, represent Wodehouse’s first magazine sales and showcase his early career. While some of these stories are definitely of a moment, they’re filled with delightful bits that would be instantly recognizable to students and teachers of any age. Indeed, the stories experienced a bit of a resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century, and remain a worthy part of Wodehouse’s canon.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s greatest showman tells the story of his life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Struggles and Triumphs</i> is the autobiography of P. T. Barnum, the celebrated American showman. Though subtitled <i>Forty Years’ Recollections</i>, it covers a period of over 60 years, from his birth in 1810, to the later years of his career in the 1870s.</p>
			<p>Barnum has an engaging style, and his autobiography is crammed with many amusing and interesting incidents as he tells how he learned to make money entertaining the public through circuses, “freak shows,” theatrical presentations, concert tours and the like. On the way he builds up an impressive fortune, only to lose it all through a fraudulous speculation perpetrated on him. Then he starts again, pays off his debts and builds up another, greater fortune. Though often labelled as a “humbug” or “a mere charlatan” it’s clear that the majority of his contemporary Americans held him in affectionate regard.</p>
			<p>However modern readers may be upset by Barnum’s rather cavalier treatment of the animals under his care in the various menageries and aquariums he created, and be distressed by the details of how they were lost in the several fires which destroyed Barnum’s Museums.</p>
			<p>Also of great interest are Barnum’s philanthropic endeavours: lecturing on teetotalism; supporting negro equality; and funding civic developments.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short works by science fiction legend Philip K. Dick.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Philip K. Dick built an enduring literary reputation writing powerful science fiction in the pulp magazines of the 50s and beyond. This collection of several of his short works, arranged in chronological order and all published in now-defunct science fiction pulp magazines, is a slice from his early career. Many of these stories explore the themes of war and whether humanity is intrinsically violent and conflict-torn. Each of them is a fascinating jewel of speculative fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">Prose poems of offering translated by the author from the original Bengali.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Indian (and more specifically Bengali) literary history, Rabindranath Tagore was the first Indian (and indeed the first person outside Europe) to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, largely in recognition of his “spiritual offering of songs,” <i>Gitanjali</i>.</p>
			<p>Tagore himself translated the poems from the original Bengali, taking many liberties in the process. His English translation is rightly recognized as a work distinct from the Bengali original, consisting of major revisions, many elisions, and many poems originally published in other collections.</p>
			<p>Tagore’s lyrical simplicity, vivid imagery, and themes of nature, spirituality, death, and transcendence, combine to produce a truly unique, powerfully moving work of thoughtful beauty. For many who read it, Tagore’s words in Song XCVI ring true: “What I have seen is unsurpassable. I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus I am blessed.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An English doctor is caught up in a rebellion and sentenced to transportation to the Caribbean, but later escapes slavery to become a pirate.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Peter Blood, with experience as a soldier and sailor, is practicing medicine in Bridgewater, England, when he inadvertently gets caught up in a rebellion being waged by the Duke of Monmouth. After being convicted of treason, Blood and some of the rebels are sentenced to slavery in the Caribbean. The year is 1688.</p>
			<p>During the course of Blood’s servitude, he works on the sugar plantation of Colonel Bishop and becomes infatuated with the colonel’s niece, Arabella. When Bishop realizes that Blood is an accomplished physician he “employs” Blood in that capacity.</p>
			<p>When the colony is attacked by a Spanish force, Blood and some of the other slaves manage to escape and take over the Spanish ship. Several of the other escapees turn out to be experienced seaman, including as officers in the British navy. This group turns the Spanish ship into a very successful pirate ship, specializing in raiding Spanish shipping.</p>
			<p>This begins Captain Blood’s journey toward redemption and his “courtship” of Arabella.</p>
			<p>Sabatini based Blood’s character on several historical figures, including a doctor who was sentenced to slavery (but did not become a pirate), as well as Henry Morgan (who was a pirate). His most well known novel was Scaramouche. Sabatini also wrote a number of short stories about Captain Blood in the early 1920s.</p>

		<summary type="text">A country lawyer finds love and adventure as he seeks revenge during the French Revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Scaramouche</i> tells the tale of André-Louis Moreau, a young lawyer in Brittany. When his friend is killed by an unremorseful landowner, Moreau swears revenge and begins a life of adventure on the run. His travels lead him to joining a traveling theater troupe, becoming a master swordsman, and even to revolution.</p>
			<p>While the story of <i>Scaramouche</i> is fiction, Sabatini was always very careful to portray history as accurately as he could in his novels. Thus, the backdrop of the French Revolution is vibrant, immediate, and carefully described. In general Sabatini’s prose is sharp and entertaining.</p>
			<p><i>Scaramouche</i> was incredibly popular in its day, and was Sabatini’s most famous novel. The first line is written on Sabatini’s grave.</p>

		<summary type="text">An eleven-year old English boy gets involved in a continuous series of amusing adventures to the exasperation of his long-suffering family.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Just William</i>, published in 1922, was the first of a long series of well-loved books about William Brown, an eleven-year old English schoolboy, written by Richmal Crompton. William is continually scruffy and disreputable, and has a talent for getting into trouble and becoming involved in various inventive plots and scrapes, to the exasperation of his long-suffering parents and older siblings.</p>
			<p>Crompton continued to write stories about the amusing adventures and mishaps of William Brown right up until her death in 1969. Some 39 book collections of stories about William were eventually published, entertaining several generations of children. Despite this, Crompton felt her real work was in writing novels for adults, of which she wrote some 41—most now forgotten and out of print.</p>

		<summary type="text">A barbarian adventures through ancient civilizations and battles fearsome enemies in this collection of Conan the Cimmerian short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Conan, the Cimmerian barbarian, romps across the pages of Robert <abbr>E.</abbr> Howard’s Hyborian adventures, slicing down enemy after enemy and trying not to fall too hard for a succession of ladies in need of rescue. Although very much a product of the pulp fantasy magazines of the 1930s, Conan has surpassed his contemporaries to become the quintessential barbarian of the fantasy genre: the muscle-bound and instinct-led hero, always willing to fight his way out of any fix.</p>
			<p>Collected here are all ten available public domain Conan short stories and the history of Hyboria that Howard wrote as a guide for himself to write from. <i>Gods of the North</i> originally was a Conan story, but after being rejected by the first publisher was rewritten slightly to a character called Amra; it was later republished as <i>The Frost-Giant’s Daughter</i> with the name changed back. The stories were serialised (with a couple of exceptions) in <i>Weird Tales</i> magazine between 1934 and 1936, and have gone on to spawn multiple licensed and unlicensed sequels, comics, films and games.</p>

		<summary type="text">After his parents die, a young Scottish man travels to see his only remaining relative, expecting to be welcomed, but instead finds his life and liberty in grave danger.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in 1886, <i>Kidnapped</i> is an adventure novel set in Scotland in the mid-1700s, not long after the Jacobite rebellion in the Highlands which had attempted to set Bonnie Prince Charlie on the throne. This rebellion was put down brutally and afterwards the Government imposed strict controls on Highlanders, outlawing many clan leaders.</p>
			<p>The protagonist of Stevenson’s novel is young David Balfour, who is in his late teens. David sets off from his hometown after the death of both of his parents to seek out his sole remaining relative, his uncle Ebenezer. Expecting to be welcomed, he is shocked by the hostile reception he is given by the old man, who is a hermit much despised by his neighbours. Ebenezer tricks young David and arranges for him to be kidnapped and taken to be sold into slavery. A series of unexpected events occur, however, and David finds himself at large in the Highlands, seeking the help of the outlaw Alan Breck Stewart, who entangles him in further complications.</p>
			<p><i>Kidnapped</i> is one of Stevenson’s most popular novels for young people, and has been adapted several times for movies and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">A London lawyer investigates the relationship between a brilliant scientist and a misshapen misanthrope.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is the classic novella of split personality. Stevenson wrote it in just a few days while sick and bedridden, and famously burned the first draft after his wife suggested it should be written as an allegory and not as a story. He re-wrote it in three to six days, and after a few weeks of editing and revision he published what would become one of his most famous and best-selling works.</p>
			<p>The story follows a London lawyer as he investigates the relationship between a brilliant scientist and a misshappen misanthrope. As the link between the two becomes clearer, <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> develops into an allegory on the nature of good and evil.</p>

			<p><i>Treasure Island</i> isn’t just one of the most famous coming-of-age tales in modern storytelling, it’s also the book that invented everything you know about pirates: Peg legs, parrots, treasure chests, tropical islands, Long John Silver, maps marked with an “X,” swashbuckling adventure, and “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.”</p>
			<p>Its brisk pace and easy tone have stood the test of the time—<i>Treasure Island</i> is as readable, enjoyable, and memorable today as it ever was.</p>

		<summary type="text">Ten short stories of madness, hauntings, romance, and art.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The King in Yellow</i> is a fascinating, almost two-faced work. The first half consists of five legendary weird tales, loosely tied together by a fictional play—the eponymous <i>King in Yellow</i>—that drives those who read it mad. Celebrated by authors like H. P. Lovecraft and Lin Carter, these stories are classic tales of madness, despair, and strange happenings.</p>
			<p>With the fifth tale the reader finds a sort of palate-cleansing collection of short prose-poems leading into the last four stories, which take a sharp turn away from the weird and into the romantic. The concluding tales are set in the Parisian art world.</p>
			<p>In modern times <i>The King in Yellow</i> enjoys a reputation largely due to the strength of its first half of macabre tales, but by no means does that make the second half less enjoyable. Both halves are written in a quick, light prose style that demonstrates why Chambers was a best-seller in his day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of poems about the Klondike Gold Rush.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Songs of a Sourdough</i> is a collection of poems written in 1907 by Robert W. Service while he was working as a bank teller in Whitehorse, Yukon. The best-known poems are those describing life during the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s, especially his ballads “The Shooting of Dan McGrew” and the “Cremation of Sam McGee.”</p>
			<p>While some of Service’s work had previously appeared in newspapers and periodicals, <i>Songs of a Sourdough</i> was his first book. Publishers initially questioned the “moral tone” of the work with its bawdy poems depicting not just the hard lives and isolation of Yukon prospectors but also the drinking, gambling, and prostitution that was prevalent in Dawson City. However, despite these reservations, the book was an immediate success. In Canada, there were ten printings and more than 12,000 copies sold in the first year alone. Dozens of additional printings followed in subsequent years, including editions issued in Britain and the United States.</p>

		<summary type="text">The collected plays of Roswitha of Gandersheim, the tenth century German canoness, dramatist, and poet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Roswitha, also known as Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, was a tenth century German canoness, dramatist, and poet. A remarkable woman, she has been called the first Western playwright since antiquity as well as the first known woman playwright. She was inspired by the Roman comic playwright Terence, who wrote six farces filled with disguises, misunderstandings, and pagan debauchery. Upset by Terence’s immoral subject matter but also inspired by his well-crafted plays, Roswitha sought to “Christianize” his work by writing six plays of her own.</p>
			<p>Roswitha wrote six dramas in Latin. Two are concerned with the conversation of nonbelievers (<i>Gallicanus</i> and <i>Callimachus</i>), two are concerned with the repentance of sinners (<i>Abraham</i> and <i>Paphnutius</i>), and two are concerned with the martyrdom of virgins (<i>Dulcitus</i> and <i>Sapientia</i>).</p>
			<p>This edition, originally published in 1923, includes an introduction by Cardinal Francis Aidan Gasquet (an English Benedictine monk and scholar), a critical preface by the translator (Christopher St. John), and prefaces written by Roswitha herself.</p>

		<summary type="text">The legendary Baron Munchausen’s tall tales of wonder and adventure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Baron Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen, was an actual baron living in 18th-century Hanover famous for entertaining his guests with outrageously-embellished tales of his wartime exploits—so much so that his nickname in German is <i>Lügenbaron</i>, or “Baron of Lies.” When Rudolph Eric Raspe, a writer and scientist living in England, heard of the Baron’s tales, he wrote his own versions centered around a fictional Baron Munchausen.</p>
			<p>While the real Baron wasn’t amused to have his name attached to a silly character famous for his bald-faced lies, Raspe’s tales became hugely popular, reprinted for hundreds of years and illustrated just as many times. These very short tales were originally intended as contemporary satire, but their outrageous silliness is still entertaining today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short humorous fables for children, most purporting to tell the origin of animal characteristics such as the camel’s hump.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Just So Stories</i> by Rudyard Kipling, first published in 1902, is now considered to be a classic of children’s literature. The twelve tales included are all humorous “origin” stories purporting to tell how certain animals gained their distinctive features. For example, “The Elephant’s Child” tells how the elephant gained its long trunk because of a baby elephant having its nose pulled and stretched by a crocodile.</p>
			<p>The stories originated as bedtime tales Kipling invented for his daughter and told to her each night. The stories had to be told in exactly the same words each night—“just so”—or his daughter would complain.</p>
			<p>Early editions of <i>Just So Stories</i> were illustrated in black and white by Kipling himself, which lends the collection a certain charm. We have reproduced these illustrations in the Standard Ebooks edition of the book.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphaned street-urchin follows a holy man across India during the time of the British Raj, eventually gaining an education and becoming a recruit to the Great Game of espionage against the Russians.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Rudyard Kipling’s novel <i>Kim</i>, published in 1901, tells the story of Kimberly O’Hara (“Kim”), the orphaned son of an Anglo-Irish soldier, who grows up as a street-urchin on the streets of Lahore in India during the time of the British Raj. Knowing little of his parentage, he is as much a native as his companions, speaking Hindi and Urdu rather than English, cunning and street-wise.</p>
			<p>At about the age of twelve, Kim encounters an old Tibetan lama on a pilgrimage in search of a holy river. He decides to fall in with the lama on his travels, and becomes in essence the old man’s disciple. Not long after, Kim is captured at an encampment of British soldiers under suspicion of being a thief. His parentage is discovered and the officers decide he must be raised as a “Sahib” (an Englishman) and sent off to school. The interest of the British officers in Kim is not entirely disinterested, however, as they see his potential for acting as a courier and spy as part of their “Great Game” of espionage against their bitter rivals the Russians, and ensure that he is trained accordingly.</p>
			<p><i>Kim</i> is a well-loved book, often being listed as one of the best English-language novels. Its depiction of the India of the time, its varied races, religions, customs and scenery is detailed, rich and sympathetic. And the manoeuverings of the players in the Great Game make for an entertaining adventure story.</p>

		<summary type="text">Seven fable-like tales about jungle animals in India and the humans who live on the edges of their realm.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Jungle Book</i> is a short collection of stories published by Kipling in various magazines between 1893 and 1894. Kipling spent both his early years and his late teenage years in India, and that upbringing is front and center in these stories—despite them being written while he was living in Vermont, in the United States.</p>
			<p>The stories are fable-like, with most of them centering on the lives of anthropomorphised jungle animals and a few focused on human characters in India. The stories were popular from the start, and have since been adapted in countless ways in print, screen, and other media.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four generations of the Pontifex family grow to adulthood in Victorian England, encountering challenges that satirize the era along the way.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Way of All Flesh</i> is often considered to be Samuel Butler’s masterpiece, and is frequently included in many lists of best English-language novels of the 20th century. Despite this acclaim, Butler never published it in his lifetime—perhaps because the novel, a scathing, funny, and poignant satire of Victorian life, would have hit his contemporaries too close to home.</p>
			<p>The novel traces four generations of the Pontifex family, though the central character is Ernest Pontifex, the third-generation wayward son. The reader follows Ernest through the eyes of his watchful godfather, Mr. Overton, as he strikes out from home to find his way in life. His struggles along the way illustrate the complex relationships between a son and his family, and especially his father; all while satirizing Victorian ideas about family, church, marriage, and schooling.</p>

		<summary type="text">An Abyssinian prince embarks on adventures while exploring the meaning of happiness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Rasselas</i> is a fable-like story, more apologue than novel, written by Johnson in 1759 to help pay for the costs of his recently-deceased mother’s funeral. While the plot is basic and the characters are thin, the work is an important philosophical piece exploring whether or not humanity can attain happiness.</p>
			<p>Rasselas, an Abyssinian prince, travels with his sister Nekayah, her handmaiden Pekuah, and the wise poet Imlac—a proxy for Johnson himself. Their exploration of happiness and the meaning of leading a happy life is a complex and subtle one, though the work ends with “nothing concluded.” Johnson leaves the reader to ponder: Can an individual <em>ever</em> attain happiness in any meaningful sense?</p>

		<summary type="text">The diary of a man living in London in the 17th century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Pepys’ <i>Diary</i> is an incredibly frank decade-long snapshot of the life of an up and coming naval administrator in mid-17th century London. In it he describes everything from battles against the Dutch and the intrigues of court, down to the plays he saw, his marital infidelities, and the quality of the meat provided for his supper. His observations have proved invaluable in establishing an accurate record of the daily life of the people of London of that period.</p>
			<p>Pepys eventually stopped writing his diary due to progressively worse eyesight, a condition he feared. He did consider employing an amanuensis to transcribe future entries for him, but worried that the content he wanted written would be too personal. Luckily for Pepys, his eyesight difficulties never progressed to blindness and he was able to go on to become both a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society.</p>
			<p>After Pepys’ death he left his large library of books and manuscripts first to his nephew, which was then passed on to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where it survives to this day. The diary, originally written in a shorthand, was included in this trove and was eventually deciphered in the early 19th century, and published by Lord Baybrooke in 1825. This early release censored large amounts of the text, and it was only in the 1970s that an uncensored version was published. Presented here is the 1893 edition, which restores the majority of the originally censored content but omits “a few passages which cannot possibly be printed.” The rich collection of endnotes serve to further illustrate the lives of the people Pepys meets and the state of England’s internal politics and international relations at the time.</p>

		<summary type="text">A father and son duo investigate a man who is wielding ancient Egyptian magic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Perhaps best known for creating the character <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sax-rohmer/the-insidious-dr-fu-manchu">Fu-Manchu</a>, Sax Rohmer is also known for his works involving the supernatural. This novel follows Robert Cairn, his father, Dr. Bruce Cairn, and their suspicion of one Antony Ferrara.</p>
			<p>After witnessing the strange and violent death of a swan, Robert Cairn suspects that Ferrara may be involved with the death of the bird. Soon after two murders, Dr. Bruce Cairn arrives in London and warns Robert that he suspects Ferrara is using ancient Egyptian magic to accomplish his evil deeds. After a mystical attack on Robert, Dr. Cairn and his son become involved in a series of supernatural events as they work to prevent Antony Ferrara from inflicting his dark magic on more victims.</p>
			<p>Like many of his works, Rohmer includes exotic locations in this novel; first set in London, the action soon moves to the pyramids of Egypt as the father and son duo track down Ferrara. Having received both success and notoriety from Fu-Manchu, Rohmer has been given praise for <i>Brood of the Witch-Queen</i>, such as when H. P. Lovecraft favorably compared it to Bram Stoker’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker/dracula"><i>Dracula</i></a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An intrepid detective hunts the criminal mastermind Fu-Manchu through early 20th-century London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu</i>, first published in the UK as <i>The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu</i>, is the first novel to introduce the inimitable Fu-Manchu, famous not just for his moustache, but for being a nigh-unstoppable criminal mastermind and part of the “Yellow Peril.” This novel is a collection of previously-published short stories, slightly re-written by Rohmer to form a cohesive whole.</p>
			<p>The narrator, Dr. Petrie, is a sort of Watson to Nayland Smith’s Holmes; but Smith resembles more of a James Bond than a Sherlock Holmes as the two barrel through action scenes and near-death scenarios planned by Fu-Manchu, a master scientist, chemist, and poisoner.</p>
			<p>This novel was one of the first to popularize the trope of the “mysterious Chinaman,” an element that later became so clichéd that Ronald Knox, the famous detective story writer, declared that “no Chinaman must figure” in good detective stories.</p>
			<p>The casual racism evident in the characters and events is a symptom of the xenophopic climate in the UK at the time, which was precipitated by many things—the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, Chinese immigration, and other fears. Despite that racism, the plot remains fast-paced and engaging, and is lent a modern air by Fu-Manchu’s role as an early prototype for a Bond supervillain.</p>

		<summary type="text">A disgraced priest ends up adventuring with a group of societal outcasts.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Set in the 1820s in central Sweden, <i>The Story of Gösta Berling</i> follows the saga of the titular character as he falls from the priesthood and is rescued by the owner of a local estate. Joining the other saved souls in the pensioners’ wing of the mansion, he embarks upon a series of larger-than-life stories that tell of adventure, revelry, romance and sadness.</p>
			<p><i>Gösta Berling</i> was the eventual Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf’s first published novel, and was written as an entry to a magazine competition. The richly detailed landscapes of Värmland were drawn from her own upbringing there, and the local folk tales inspired many of the individual stories in the book. The original was published in Swedish in 1891; this edition is based on the 1898 English translation by Pauline Bancroft Flach.</p>

		<summary type="text">Nils Holgersson, transformed to an elf, learns the meaning of kindness during his adventures with a flock of wild geese.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>The Wonderful Adventures of Nils</i>, Selma Lagerlöf tells the story of Nils Holgersson, a young boy who is transformed into an elf after a set of misdeeds. Escaping with his family’s farm goose he joins up with a flock of wild geese and travels with them across Sweden as they return to their annual nesting grounds in Lapland.</p>
			<p>The story was originally written as a commission for the Swedish National Teachers’ Association to write a geography book for children and has become a firm favourite in the country. It’s been adapted for screen many times, translated into over 30 languages and, until recently, was the artwork on the 20 krona banknote.</p>
			<p>Although originally published in English in two volumes—the second starting at “The Story of Karr and Grayskin”—here they are presented as a single combined story.</p>

		<summary type="text">Seneca’s dialogues and consolations, including “On Benefits,” examine living life through the lens of Stoic philosophy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Seneca the Younger was a statesman and philosopher who lived in Rome around the dawn of the Common Era. Though he wrote a large amount of tragedies and other works, today he’s perhaps best known for his writing on Stoic philosophy and principles.</p>
			<p>Seneca didn’t write books about Stoicism; rather, he composed essays and sent letters over the course of his lifetime that addressed that philosophy. Since these essays and letters are addressed to his friends and contemporaries, they’re written in a conversational style, and thus referred to as his “Dialogues.” Some were written to friends on the death of their loved ones, in an effort to console and comfort them. Others were written to help friends with their personality flaws, like anger. One, “On Clemency,” was addressed to the emperor Nero as an effort to guide him on the path of good statesmanship.</p>
			<p>This collection contains all of his dialogues, including the longer “On Benefits.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A Union soldier in the American Civil War longs to prove his courage in battle.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Henry Fleming has joined the Union army because of his romantic ideas of military life, but soon finds himself in the middle of a battle against a regiment of Confederate soldiers. Terrified, Henry deserts his comrades. Upon returning to his regiment, he struggles with his shame as he tries to redeem himself and prove his courage.</p>
			<p><i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> is Stephen Crane’s second book, notable for its realism and the fact that Crane had never personally experienced battle. Crane drew heavy inspiration from <i>Century Magazine</i>, a periodical known for its articles about the American Civil War. However, he criticized the articles for their lack of emotional depth and decided to write a war novel of his own. The manuscript was first serialized in December 1894 by <i>The Philadelphia Press</i> and quickly won Crane international acclaim before he died in June 1900 at the age of 28.</p>

		<summary type="text">A humorous account of life in the fictional small town of Mariposa.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town</i> is Stephen Leacock’s humourous and affectionate account of small-town life in the fictional town of Mariposa. Written in 1912, it is drawn from his experiences living in Orillia, Ontario.</p>
			<p>The book is a series of funny and satirical anecdotes that illustrate the inner workings of life in Mariposa⁠—from business to politics to steamboat disasters. The town is populated by many archetypal characters including the shrewd businessman Mr. Smith, the lovelorn bank teller Mr. Pupkin, and the mathematically challenged Rev. Mr. Drone.</p>
			<p>During his lifetime, Stephen Leacock was very popular in much of the English-speaking world as a writer and humourist. <i>Sunshine Sketches</i> is considered one of his most notable and enduring works. In Canada, the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour is named in his honour. The medal is an annual award for the best Canadian book of literary humour published in the previous year.</p>

		<summary type="text">The lives of the twelve emperors called Caesar are described in detail by a near-contemporary Roman historian.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Suetonius was a Roman historian born in about 69 AD, shortly after the death of the emperor Nero. This book, detailing the lives of the twelve Roman emperors who were known as “Caesar”—some by a family connection to Julius Caesar, some just as a title—is considered to be Suetonius’ most important work.</p>
			<p><i>The Lives of the Caesars</i> is a detailed account of the often dramatic lives of these emperors, whose abilities and morals varied enormously; from the capable, stable Augustus, to the insane Caligula. Several of these men died violently either by their own hand or by assassins. Suetonius, though, is careful to give credit where it is due, outlining the better actions and laws of each alongside an account of the crimes and immoralities they also carried out.</p>
			<p>This turbulent period of Roman history has often been depicted in fiction and in media, drawing on the work of Suetonius and other contemporary historians. For example, Robert Graves’ novel <i>I, Claudius</i> (1934), which was made into a highly-controversial television series by the BBC in 1976.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of T. S. Eliot’s poetry, including “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” and “The Waste Land.”</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Poetry</i> of T. S. Eliot collects all of his early work through “The Waste Land.” Poems like “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” “Whispers of Immortality,” and “Gerontion” ponder aging and mortality, while “Sweeney Erect,” “Mr. Eliot’s Sunday Service,” and “Sweeney Among the Nightingales” sketch the temptations and agonies of the modern man in the character of Sweeney.</p>
			<p>Woven throughout with allusions to works in six foreign languages and sporting over fifty footnotes by the author, “The Waste Land” is as notorious for its bleak picture of a post-war world as it is for its density and difficulty.</p>
			<p>Eliot’s flashes of insight bring the everyday into stark relief. Whether suffering an insufferable bore, observing the lives of strangers on the streets, or juxtaposing the sacred and the profane, his sometimes autobiographical vignettes of modern life still feel current a century after they were penned.</p>

		<summary type="text">An American classicist collects and explains myths and legends ranging from those of the ancient Greeks and Romans, through stories of King Arthur, to the legends of Charlemagne.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Thomas Bulfinch was an American banker and Latin scholar. <i>Bulfinch’s Mythology</i> is a posthumous compilation of three volumes published by Bulfinch during his lifetime which were intended to introduce the general reader to the myths and legends of Western Civilization by presenting them in simple prose with occasional commentary by the author. Bulfinch also includes many quotations showing how these stories have been handled by poets and playwrights of later years.</p>
			<p>The three original volumes are <i>The Age of Fable</i> (1855), dealing largely with Greek and Roman mythology but also touching on the mythology of other cultures such as the Indian, Egyptian and Norse myths; <i>The Age of Chivalry</i> (1858), dealing with Arthurian legend, the Holy Grail and the Mabinogeon; and <i>Legends of Charlemagne</i> (1863), dealing with the fantastical legends surrounding Charlemagne and his “paladins” such as Orlando, Oliver and Rogero.</p>
			<p>The combined volume entitled <i>Bulfinch’s Mythology</i> quickly became very popular, and by some accounts it is one of the most popular books ever published in the United States.</p>

		<summary type="text">The meta-fictional commentary on the life of “famous” German philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh and his Philosophy of Clothes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sartor Resartus</i> was a strange and new book when it was first published in 1833, and in many ways it remains a strange and new book today. The bulk of the novel takes the form of the a commentary on the life and works of the fictional Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a sort of renaissance-man German philosopher who develops a “Philosophy of Clothes.” The commentary is composed by a fictional English commentator, known only as the “Editor”; the Editor claims to have translated many of Teufelsdröckh’s ideas and quotes from German. As the commentary progresses, the Editor receives a bag of paper scraps on which are written various autobiographical fragments from Teufelsdröckh’s life. The Editor’s attempts to organize and interpret these scraps forms the second part of the novel.</p>
			<p>The work is multi-faceted: sometimes a parody, sometimes a comedy, sometimes a satire, and sometimes seriously philosophical. Some critics consider it an early existentialist text. At the very least its unique structure and use of meta-narrative is hugely influential to modern literature; Borges was said to have memorized entire pages, and modern texts like Nabokov’s <i>Pale Fire</i> borrow liberally from the concept of a meta-narrative organized on scraps of paper.</p>

		<summary type="text">A portrait of the life of a drug addict in Georgian-era London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Thomas De Quincey spent much of his life addicted to the powerful drug opium. This book, first published anonymously in the <i>London Magazine</i>, is the autobiographical account of his addiction. De Quincey’s compelling language and frankness give the reader a window in to both the strange pleasures and the horrible pains of that famous drug.</p>
			<p>As the science of addiction was an unheard of thing at the time, De Quincey’s account became a sort of authoritative reference for decades, with people going so far as to denounce the book or presenting too pleasurable a picture of opium use. His work stands as a fascinating window into the life of a Georgian-era addict in one of the busiest cities in the world.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of prose poems inspired by De Quincey’s opium dreams.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Suspiria</i> is a collection of prose poems, or what De Quincey called “impassioned prose,” eratically written and published starting in 1854. Each Suspiria is a short essay written in reflection of the opium dreams De Quincey would experience over the course of his lifetime addiction, and they are considered by some critics to be some of the finest examples of prose poetry in all of English literature.</p>
			<p>De Quincey originally planned them as a sequel of sorts to his <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-de-quincey/confessions-of-an-english-opium-eater">Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</a></i>, but the first set was published separately in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> in the spring and summer of that 1854. De Quincey then published a revised version of those first Suspiria, along with several new ones, in his collected works. During his life he kept a master list of titles of the Suspiria he planned on writing, and completed serveral more before his death; those that survived time and fire were published posthumously in 1891.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young shepherd falls in love with a young, seemingly independent and strong-willed lady famer.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> was Thomas Hardy’s fourth novel and was completed in 1874. It was originally serialized in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> and was quickly published in a successful single volume.</p>
			<p>Hardy described Wessex as “a merely realistic dream country” and so it is in <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>, where an idyllic view of the countryside is interrupted by the bitter reality of farming life. The novel is the first that Hardy sets in fictional Wessex; he quickly realised that setting novels there could be a money-earner that would subsidise his poetry-writing ambitions.</p>
			<p>Gabriel Oak, the faithful man and aspiring farmer; Bathsheba Everdene, the young and independent lady farmer; William Boldwood, the lonely neighbour; and Sergeant Troy, the dashing military man, all lead intertwined lives which are full of love and loss.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman of poor and uneducated parents is driven by guilt to try to redeem her family’s fortunes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</i> is said to be Thomas Hardy’s fictional masterpiece and is considered to be an important nineteenth century novel. It explores themes of love, sex, class and morality in an aching love story.</p>
			<p>It initially appeared in a censored, serialised version in <i>The Graphic</i> in 1891 and was published in a single volume the following year. Early reviews were mixed, partly because of its challenge to Victorian sexual morals—it is now looked upon much more favorably.</p>
			<p>Tess Durbeyfield is the oldest child of uneducated peasants who are given the impression that they may have noble blood, as their surname is a corruption of that of an extinct Norman family. When Tess participates in the village May Dance, she meets Angel, who stops to join the dance but notices Tess too late to dance with her. That night, Tess’s father gets too drunk to drive to the market, so she undertakes the journey herself. However, she falls asleep at the reins, and the family’s only horse encounters a speeding wagon and is fatally wounded. Tess feels so guilty over the consequences for the family that she agrees to try to claim kin with a rich widow who lives in a neighbouring town. The story traces Tess’s life through the following years.</p>
			<p>The novel has been adapted for the stage, theatre, opera, cinema and television numerous times since its publication.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Grace Melbury, daughter of a rich local wood-trader, has been raised beyond her family through years of expensive education. Coming home, she finds herself pulled between her love for her childhood friend Giles Winterborne, and the allure of the enigmatic Doctor Fitzpiers. Giles and Edgar have their own admirers too, and the backdrop of the bucolic pastures and woodlands of an impressionistic take on south-west England provides the perfect setting for their story.</p>
			<p><i>The Woodlanders</i> was commissioned by <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> in 1884, and was serialized and later published as a novel in 1887. The story’s themes of infidelity and less-than-blissful marriage were unusual for the time and drew ire from campaigners, but on its publication it garnered immediate critical acclaim. Thomas Hardy later regarded it as the favorite of his stories, and it’s remained perennially popular as a novel and as a series of adaptations to theatre, opera and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comic parody of the gothic movement in early nineteenth-century British literature</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1818, Peacock’s novella <i>Nightmare Abbey</i> is a gentle satire of the then-popular gothic movement in literature. He pokes fun at the genre’s obsessions and most of the book’s characters are caricatures of well-known personages of the time.</p>
			<p>Young Scythrop is the only son of Mr. Glowry, living in the semi-ruined Nightmare Abbey on his estate in Lincolnshire. Mr. Glowry, the survivor of a miserable marriage, is addicted to the depressing and the morbid, surrounding himself with servants whose names, such as Raven, Graves and Skellet, reflect his obsessions. His friends, also, are chosen from those who best reflect his misanthropic views.</p>
			<p>Scythrop himself imagines himself a philosopher with a unique view of the world, and to this end has written a treatise titled “Philosophical Gas; or, a Project for a General Illumination of the Human Mind.” Only seven copies of this treatise have ever been sold, and Scythrop dreams of being united with one of the buyers. His passions, though, become more earthy when he falls in love both with his cousin Marionetta and then also with a mysterious woman who appears in his apartment and begs him for asylum, thus creating a situation of romantic farce as he tries to decide between the two.</p>
			<p>These events are interleaved beween entertaining discussions among the varied guests at Nightmare Abbey, richly filled with humor, allusions and quotation.</p>
			<p><i>Nightmare Abbey</i> is probably Peacock’s most successful work of fiction, and helped establish his position as an important satirist of his times. His satire, though, is light-hearted rather than savage and is directed more at foolish opinions than attacking particular persons.</p>

		<summary type="text">A rough American from a distant branch of the Trenchard family returns to England and quickly becomes embroiled in the family’s affairs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Our American Cousin</i> is a three-act play written by English playwright Tom Taylor. The play opened in London in 1858 but quickly made its way to the U.S. and premiered at Laura Keene’s Theatre in New York City later that year. It remained popular in the U.S. and England for the next several decades. Its most notable claim to fame, however, is that it was the play U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was watching on April 14, 1865 when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, who used his knowledge of the script to shoot Lincoln during a more raucous scene.</p>
			<p>The play is a classic Victorian farce with a whole range of stereotyped characters, business, and many entrances and exits. The plot features a boorish but honest American cousin who travels to the aristocratic English countryside to claim his inheritance, and then quickly becomes swept up in the family’s affairs. An inevitable rescue of the family’s fortunes and of the various damsels in distress ensues.</p>
			<p><i>Our American Cousin</i> was originally written as a farce for an English audience, with the laughs coming mostly at the expense of the naive American character. But after it moved to the U.S. it was eventually recast as a comedy where English caricatures like the pompous Lord Dundreary soon became the primary source of hilarity. This early version, published in 1869, contains fewer of that character’s nonsensical adages, which soon came to be known as “Dundrearyisms,” and for which the play eventually gained much of its popular appeal.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the greatest generals of the United States tells the story of his life and details his key role in winning the Civil War.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Personal Memoirs</i> of Ulysses Simpson Grant are an American classic. In them Grant, the most able General of the Civil War, tells the story of his life and experiences, covering his birth, early youth, military training at West Point, his involvement as a Lieutenant in the Mexican War of 1847–48, and of course, his role in the Civil War of 1861–65, during which he rose to become the supreme commander of the Northern forces. After the Mexican War, Grant had left military service and became, essentially, an unsuccessful shopkeeper. Re-enlisting at the start of the Civil War, he rose to his ultimate position entirely on his own merits, showing himself to be a skilled strategist and a master of logistics.</p>
			<p>What distinguishes Grant’s <i>Personal Memoirs</i>, and makes them a clear candidate for being considered a part of American literature, is the high quality and interest of the writing, for which Grant clearly had a talent. Though he goes into an extremely high level of detail about the military movements and struggles of the Civil War, the book is full of interest, and in parts is as gripping as a novel.</p>
			<p>Obviously, Grant tells only his own part of the story and from the perspective of the ultimately successful forces; but his humanity shows through in the respect he offers to those on the other side, and in his acknowledgment of their sufferings, despite his clear condemnation of their cause of preserving slavery. He is generous in awarding due credit to others on his own side, and where blame is due tempering it with his understanding of that person’s character, background and circumstances.</p>
			<p>After the war, Grant served two terms as President of the United States between 1869–77, but his <i>Memoirs</i> do not deal with this period. He began writing the book on his retirement, and completed it only after suffering from severe illness and not long before his death from throat cancer. The first edition was published in two volumes by Mark Twain in 1885.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition includes 43 maps reproduced from the 1895 edition of the <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A working-class Lithuanian immigrant family’s struggle to make a living in the turn-of-the-century Chicago stockyards.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Jungle</i> is one of the most famous muckraking novels in modern history. Set in Chicago at the dawn of the 20th century, it tells the story of an immigrant Lithuanian family trying to make it in a new world both cruel and full of opportunity. Their struggles are in part a vehicle for Sinclair to shine a spotlight on the monstrous conditions of the meatpacking industry, to expose the brutal exploitation of immigrants and workers, and to espouse his more socialist worldview.</p>
			<p>The novel is in part responsible for the passage of the revolutionary Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug act, and thus the establishment of the modern-day Food and Drug administration in the US. Its impact is in no small part due to the direct and powerful prose Sinclair employs: the horrors of commercial meat production are presented in full and glistening detail, and the tragedies and misfortunes of the Rudkus family are direct and relatable even today.</p>

			<p>This epic novel tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who is attempting to escape from his past. Newly released from the galley-ships, Jean Valjean steals the silverware from the bishop who has taken him in for the night. When he is captured, the bishop urges him to use the silver to become an honest citizen. Valjean becomes a wealthy man, owner of a factory and mayor of his town but his past is only a footstep away in the form of Javert, Inspector of Police, who recognises Valjean from his time as a guard.</p>
			<p>A factory-worker, who has been dismissed from Valjean’s employment, is sentenced to six months imprisonment but ends up dying in the town’s hospital and Valjean feels responsible for the downward spiral of her life, so rescues her child, Cosette, from the corrupt inn-keepers with whom her mother had left her.</p>
			<p>The rest of the novel tells the stories of Valjean, Cosette and other characters which interwine with each other. Hugo also included a number of “digressions” on subjects including cloistered religious orders, the use of slang language and, most significantly, the battle of Waterloo.</p>
			<p>The book was highly anticipated in 1862, having been advertised from as early as 1860. Hugo did not allow the publishers to summarise the story in advance, surely because any summary could not do a novel of this length any justice.</p>

		<summary type="text">An archdeacon of Notre-Dame and his bellringer fall in love with the same gypsy, with tragic results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Esmeralda is a breathtaking beauty and attracts the attention of men all around her, including an actor, a captain, and an archdeacon, to whom she is of course forbidden. But because of a kindness she paid to him, there is one whose love for her is pure: the archdeacon’s bellringer. The actions of the archdeacon, who cannot control his lust for the young woman, ultimately draws all four men into her orbit, and his, with tragic consequences.</p>
			<p>Hugo’s tragic novel is an ode to gothic architecture in general and that of Notre-Dame de Paris in particular. Hugo was upset both at the neglect of buildings like Notre-Dame, and the modernization of those that weren’t being neglected. By centering on the building, he was able to bring all classes into his story: from kings and nobles to bellringers and sewer rats. The first American translation changed the title to “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” shifting attention to the bellringer, but Hugo’s focus was always on Notre-Dame and the beautiful gothic architecture of Paris.</p>

		<summary type="text">A sheltered young woman’s travels dramatically expand her horizons.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Miss Rachel Vinrace, aged twenty-four and previously interested only in music, is on a voyage both literal and metaphorical. An ocean cruise with her father leaves her for the summer at her Aunt’s villa in an unnamed South American country, where she meets the English inhabitants of the local town’s hotel. As the season progresses she starts to become entangled in their own lives and passions, and through those burgeoning acquaintances and friendships the discovery of her own nature grows.</p>
			<p><i>The Voyage Out</i> is Virginia Woolf’s first novel and was a labour of love, taking her five years to complete. Even though heavy editing was required to reduce some of the more politically charged themes before its publication in 1915, it still bemused some contemporary critics and even garnered accusations of “reckless femininity.” Time however has proved kinder, with the book demonstrating the key points of Woolf’s future style. It even has the first appearance of Clarissa Dalloway, the titular protagonist of Woolf’s later and more famous novel <i><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dalloway</i>.</p>

			<p><i>Candide</i> is the picaresque tale of the titular character’s fantastical journey from an insular, idealized life in a picturesque castle through the difficulties and evils of the real world. Satirical, comical, witty, and cutting, <i>Candide</i> was widely banned in its day for containing blasphemous and seditious concepts. Despite that, it survived controversy to become an important book in the Western literary heritage. Today <i>Candide</i> remains a breezy and darkly funny read.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Vsevolod Garshin’s literary career followed a stint as a infantry soldier and later an officer, and he received both public and critical acclaim in the 1880s. Before his sadly early death at the age of thirty-three after a lifelong battle with mental illness he wrote and published nineteen short stories. He drew on his military career and life in St. Petersburg as initial source material, and his varied cast of characters includes soldiers, painters, architects, madmen, bears, frogs and even flowers and trees. All are written with a depth of feeling and sympathy that marks Garshin out from his contemporaries.</p>
			<p>Collected here are the seventeen translations into English by Rowland Smith of Garshin’s short stories and novellas, in chronological order of the original Russian publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">Maugham’s semi-autobiographical masterpiece follows a club-footed orphan’s rise in the medical profession and his lifelong search for happiness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Considered by many to be Maugham’s masterpiece, <i>Of Human Bondage</i> is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale. The novel follows Philip, a sensitive young man interested in literature and art, as he searches for happiness in London and Paris. Philip, the ostensible stand-in for Maugham, suffers from a club foot, a physical representation of the stutter that Maugham himself suffered. Philip’s love life, a central aspect to the book, also mirrors Maugham’s own stormy affairs.</p>
			<p>Maugham originally titled the book “Beauty from Ashes” before settling on the final title, taken from a section of Spinoza’s <i>Ethics</i> in which he discusses how one’s inability to control one’s emotions results in a form of bondage.</p>

		<summary type="text">London Stockbroker Charles Strickland abandons his family and travels to Paris to become a painter.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Moon and Sixpence</i> tells the story of English stockbroker Charles Strickland, who abandons his wife and child to travel to Paris to become a painter. First published in 1919 in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, the story is inspired by the life of the French artist Paul Gauguin. It’s told in episodic form from a first-person perspective. The narrator, who came to know Strickland through his wife’s literary parties, begins the story as Strickland leaves for Paris. Strickland’s new life becomes a stark contrast to his life in London. While he was once a well-off banker living a comfortable life, he must now sleep in cheap hotels while suffering both illness and hunger.</p>
			<p>Maugham spent a year in Paris in 1904, which is when he first heard the story of Gauguin, the banker who left his family and profession to pursue his passion for art. He heard the story from others who had known and worked with Gauguin. Ten years later Maugham travelled to Tahiti where he met others who had known Gauguin during the artist’s time there. Inspired by the stories he heard, Maugham wrote <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i>. Although based on the life of Paul Gauguin, the story is a work of fiction.</p>

			<p>W. W. Jacobs was a prolific writer of short stories. His topics were typically humorous and nautical in nature, but they weren’t exclusively so.

		<summary type="text">A disinherited knight returns from the Crusades and fights back against Prince John’s reign.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Set in 12th-century England, Prince John rules while his brother King Richard is away during the Crusades. During his reign, Prince John and others of Norman nobility abuse their power over the Saxons, forcing Saxons off their lands and many Saxon nobles into serfdom.</p>
			<p>Ivanhoe, a man disowned by his own Saxon father for going to war alongside the Norman King Richard, returns from the Crusades in disguise and appears in a tournament at Ashby. After revealing himself, Prince John and his advisors learn that King Richard, too, has returned from the crusades.</p>
			<p>Foiling Prince John’s plot against King Richard’s return to power, King Richard battles against Prince John’s allies, and executes the most guilty of his conspirators. After the events of the story, Ivanhoe leads a heroic career under King Richard until the king’s untimely death.</p>
			<p><i>Ivanhoe</i> is the first novel to feature the character Robin Hood, his merry men, and Friar Tuck, and serves as the basis for the portrayals of his character we still see in many modern adaptations.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of 34 essays and short stories, including “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle.”</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Initially published throughout 1819 and 1820, <i>The Sketch-Book</i> is a collection of 34 essays and short stories, collected and ordered according to the Author’s Revised Edition published in 1848. <i>The Sketch-Book</i> is the first publication to use Irving’s pseudonym Geoffrey Crayon, which he would carry into later works.</p>
			<p>The stories vary in nature, from the comical “The Mutability of Literature” to the eerie and seemingly supernatural “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” but the personality of their narrator, Geoffrey Crayon, connects the stories and attracts their readers. Some stories are written on American topics, forming the need for separate American and English editions, and others consist of English life and landscape, written from the perspective of living in England for a time.</p>
			<p>Two of the stories, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle,” are Irving’s most well-known works, and are presented as posthumous writings of fictional Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker. From these stories came the iconic characters Rip Van Winkle, Ichabod Crane, and the Headless Horseman.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Wilfred Owen’s published poems.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Wilfred Owen was a soldier and poet during the second half of the first World War. His poetry, contrary to the propaganda of the time, dealt with the horrors of front-line trench warfare and was written at least partially out of a sense of duty to tell of the realities of war. Most of his poetry was published posthumously in 1920 after his death in combat in November 1918, a mere week before the armistice was signed.</p>
			<p>His poetry, along with that of his close friend Siegfried Sassoon, is now regarded as an authentic voice of the experiences of the soldiers of the War. Held in especially high regard are <i xml:lang="la">Dulce Et Decorum Est</i> with its vivid description of a gas attack, and <i>Anthem for Doomed Youth</i>. The poems are here presented in chronological order according to the date of final revision.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman who has been made pregnant by an unscrupulous man tries to force him to marry her secretly, but much goes wrong with her plan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Man and Wife</i> is the ninth novel by Wilkie Collins, and was published in serial form in 1870. Like many of his other novels it has a complex plot and tackles social issues, in this case the then-lax state of the marriage laws, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. As always, Collins deals carefully but frankly with human personal behavior. To avoid offending Victorian morals too greatly, much is implied rather than stated outright. Nevertheless, even dealing with such matters at all led to his novels being derided as “sensation ficton” by his critics. By today’s standards, of course, they wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow.</p>
			<p>In <i>Man and Wife</i>, the main character Anne Silvester has fallen pregnant to a muscular and handsome, but boorish man, Geoffrey Delamayn, to whom she is not married. She is working as a governess at a house in Scotland. Anne arranges to meet Delamayn secretly at a garden party and angrily demands that he fulfill his promise to marry her, that very day. He very reluctantly agrees to a secret, private marriage, knowing that a public marriage would badly affect his inheritance prospects. How is the marriage to be arranged quickly but kept quiet? Anne has a plan based on her understanding of the looseness of the marriage laws in Scotland. Naturally, of course, things go badly wrong with this plan and many complexities arise.</p>
			<p>Collins is deeply critical of the state of contemporary marriage laws, both in how loosely they were framed, and in how little power over their own lives they gave to women once they were married, even if married to a brutal man. He also uses this novel to denounce the worship of sporting heroes and the obsession with physical prowess rather than mental superiority as a primary indication of male virtue.</p>
			<p>Though not as popular as his novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white"><i>The Woman in White</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone"><i>The Moonstone</i></a>, <i>Man and Wife</i> received a good critical reception when it was released and was a commercial success.</p>

		<summary type="text">After two sisters are unexpectedly and shockingly disinherited, the headstrong younger sister takes increasingly desperate measures to try to wrest back her family’s fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>No Name</i> is set in England during the 1840s. It follows the fortunes of two sisters, Magdalen Vanstone and her older sister Norah. Their comfortable upper-middle-class lives are shockingly disrupted when, after the sudden deaths of their parents, they discover that they are disinherited and left without either name or fortune. The headstrong Magdalen vows to recover their inheritance, by fair means or foul. Her increasing desperation makes her vulnerable to a wily confidence trickster, Captain Wragge, who promises to assist her in return for a cut of the profits.</p>
			<p><i>No Name</i> was published in serial form like many of Wilkie Collins’ other works. They were tremendously popular in their time, with long queues forming awaiting the publication of each episode. Though not as well known as his <i>The Woman in White</i> and <i>The Moonstone</i>, <i>No Name</i> is their equal in boasting a gripping plot and strong women characters (a rarity in the Victorian era). Collins’ mentor Charles Dickens is on record as considering it to be far the superior of <i>The Woman in White</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">When a fabulous gem mysteriously goes missing, suspicion abounds and a hunt begins for the guilty party.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The “Moonstone” of the title is a large but flawed diamond, looted from India at the time of the Mutiny by an unscrupulous British officer. Many years later, estranged from his family due to his licentious lifestyle, the officer bequeaths the diamond to his sister’s daughter, Rachel Verrinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday. Due to the ill-omens surrounding the gem, this may have been an act of revenge rather than reconciliation. The diamond, it appears, was taken from a statue of the Moon God worshipped by a Hindu cult, and it has long been sought by a group of Brahmins determined to return it to their temple.</p>
			<p>On the night of the birthday party the gem mysteriously disappears from Rachel’s room. While the first suspicions naturally fall on these Indians, they are eventually exculpated. Rachel becomes hysterical and angry when questioned about the theft and refuses to assist the police. Active efforts to assist them are taken up by Rachel’s cousin (and sweetheart) Franklin Blake. These efforts simply drive Rachel into further fury, and she becomes completely estranged from him. Suspicion thus falls on her as having some secret reason for wishing to raise money on the diamond. The novel proceeds to slowly uncover the mysteries involved.</p>
			<p>Published in 1868, <i>The Moonstone</i> is often considered as one of the precursors of the modern detective novel, though this is a label which would not have been used by its author Wilkie Collins and his contemporaries. While it is true that the plot revolves around the mystery of a theft, and that it features Sergeant Cuff “in the Detective Force of Scotland Yard,” the novel is much more about character and relationships than the mere revelation of secrets. It also has a good dose of Collins’ humour, as the story is told in large part by eccentric characters such as the old house-steward Gabriel Betteredge who regards <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> as an oracle; and the ultra-religious Miss Clack, determined to convert everyone to her views.</p>
			<p>Immensely popular at the time of its publication in serial form, <i>The Moonstone</i> is rightly considered to be one of Collins’ best works, and remains highly regarded today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young drawing teacher falls in love with his aristocratic pupil, who falls victim to a devious plot to acquire her considerable fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Woman in White</i> tells the story of Walter Hartright, a young and impoverished drawing teacher who falls in love with his aristocratic pupil, Laura Fairlie. He cannot hope to marry her, however, and she is married off against her will to a baronet, Sir Percival Glyde, who is seeking her fortune. The terms of her marriage settlement prevent Glyde accessing her money while she lives, so together with his deceptively charming and cunning friend, Count Fosco, they hatch an unscrupulous deception to do so nonetheless. In an early 19th Century version of “identity theft,” they contrive to fake Laura’s death and confine her to a mental asylum. Their plot is eventually uncovered and exposed by Hartright with the help of Laura’s resourceful half-sister, Marian Halcombe.</p>
			<p><i>The Woman in White</i> was the most popular of Wilkie Collins’ novels in the genre then known as “sensation fiction.” It has never been out of print and is frequently included in lists of the best novels of all time. Published initially in serial form in 1859–60, it achieved an early and remarkable following, probably because of the strength of its characters, in particular the smooth and charming but utterly wicked villain Count Fosco, and the intelligent and steadfast Marian Halcombe opposed to him.</p>

		<summary type="text">Orphaned boy Jim meets Ántonia, the daughter of a Czech family who has immigrated to Nebraska.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in the style of a memoir, <i>My Ántonia</i> chronicles Jim Burden’s friendship with the daughter of a Czech immigrant family. Recently orphaned, he moves west to Nebraska to live with his grandparents. Riding the same train is the Shimerda family, who are also on their way to settle in the area. The Shimerdas have a difficult life as pioneers: living in a sod house, working the fields, and running out of food in the winter. Jim soon becomes smitten with Ántonia, the eldest daughter, as they grow up and explore the landscape around them together. Through his eyes, we see both how she shapes the land around her and is shaped by the rigors of poverty.</p>
			<p>Similarly to Jim, Willa Cather spent her early years in Nebraska but most of her adult life in Eastern cities. She pays homage to her homeland with her Prairie Trilogy of novels, comprised of <i>O Pioneers!</i>, <i>The Song of the Lark</i>, and <i>My Ántonia</i>. They are tinged with her characteristic straightforward language, reverence for nature, and nostalgia, even as she acknowledges the hardships of the past.</p>
			<p>Published in 1918 to great enthusiasm, <i>My Ántonia</i> is considered one of Cather’s finest works and a defining point in her identity as a writer.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Poems</i> is an anthology of William Carlos Williams’ poetry collections, combining <i>The Tempers</i> (1913), <i>Al Que Quiere!</i> (1917), and <i>Sour Grapes</i> (1921). Williams is recognized as one of the foremost poets of American Modernism. In these collections a reader may perceive Williams’ contact with and subsequent growth through and away from Imagism. The poet’s work asserts a decidedly American approach to Modernism and features highly localized diction and imagery.</p>
			<p>William Carlos Williams was born in 1883, grew up in New Jersey, and was educated in Europe and the United States. He was friends with Hilda Doolittle “H. D.” and Ezra Pound, and through these friendships was introduced to Imagism. He eventually broke with the Imagists and invested himself instead in capturing the unique diction and linguistic intermingling of the United States, while remaining committed to the concreteness that characterizes Imagism. A practising doctor, Williams included many images of bodies, sickness, and medical care in his early poems. Williams later claimed there are “no ideas but in things,” a sentiment rooted in both his contact with Imagism and his firm sense of place.</p>
			<p>Williams continued to read and respond to expatriate and English Modernism, culminating in his long work <i>Paterson</i>. In his later career Williams influenced postwar literary movements, most notably the Beat Generation. He died in 1963.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of essays on art, literature, philosophy, society, and culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>William Hazlitt was a well-regarded critic and essayist in his day, and <i>Table-Talk</i>, a collection of some of his more popular short essays, is perhaps his best-remembered work.</p>
			<p>The essays themselves range in subject from philosophy, to art, to literature, culture, society, and politics, with titles like “On the Pleasures of Painting” and “On Corporate Bodies.” Hazlitt’s intimate style and deep familiarity with many different aspects of art culture (not only was he a literary success, but he studied under Joshua Reynolds to be a portrait painter) make his essays fascinating multi-disciplinary reads.</p>
			<p><i>Table-Talk</i> was originally published in two separate volumes, and, largely due to Hazlitt’s political activism, was received poorly by his contemporaries. Today it’s considered one of his masterpieces.</p>

		<summary type="text">An account of the terrifying metaphysical haunting of a recluse’s secluded home.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The House on the Borderland is unique in several ways. The narrative itself is a double-frame narrative: the editor of the volume is presenting a manuscript he found under mysterious circumstances, describing the account of two fishermen who themselves discovered a hand-written account of the cosmic haunting of a recluse’s remote home.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the novel is one of the earliest examples of the departure of horror fiction from the Gothic style of supernatural, psychological hauntings, to more realist, science-fiction/cosmic horror themes. The recluse is, among other events, transported to a mysterious supra-universal plane populated by monsters and elder gods; and his house withstands assaults from legions of monsters as he travels across time and the solar system.</p>
			<p>The book was very influential on H. P. Lovecraft, who himself was famous for the cosmic horror themes in his work. The concept of an uncaring, and even evil, universe that Lovecraft found so disturbing is front and center in this supremely strange novel.</p>
			<p>The original print edition of this novel contains a pathological number of commas—so much so that even Hodgson’s contemporary readers would have found them distracting at best and plainly ungrammatical at worst. The editors of this Standard Ebooks edition have made an effort to remove the most egregious cases of these ungrammatical commas, so that modern readers can better enjoy this unique tale.</p>

		<summary type="text">A 17th-century gentleman is reincarnated on a far-future Earth where the sun has died, and scours the hellish landscape for his lost love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Night Land</i> is science fiction ahead of its time. Published in 1912, the book introduces a 17th-century gentleman who loses his wife. He soon discovers himself somehow reanimated in Earth’s far future, millions of years from now, when the sun has died and the Earth has become a hellish waste. What remains of humanity lives in titanic mile-high pyramids surrounded by energy shields to protect them from the abhuman monsters lurking in the darkness.</p>
			<p>The human survivors soon receive a distress signal sent by a long-forgotten lesser pyramid, and the narrator embarks on a bloody quest to rescue the maiden of the pyramid—which he knows to be his lost love, somehow transcending time and space. On his journey the narrator is beset by countless horrifying monsters, many of them mutated former-humans. These depictions are so singular that H. P. Lovecraft called <i>The Night Land</i> “one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written.”</p>
			<p>The novel is unique in its farsighted depiction of technology. The narrator has telepathic powers and is able to communicate with others over long distances. These powers are enabled by his “brain elements,” which are possibly surgically-implanted. Telepathic communications may be spied upon by the monsters of the waste, but a “master word” sent by the caller may verify the integrity of the signal—a description of a kind of early public-key cryptography.</p>
			<p>The narrator survives on food pellets and “powdered water,” predicting a kind of astronaut food. His weapon of choice is a Diskos, a kind of whirling razor-sharp blade that shoots fire and energy. The machines and force fields of the human pyramid monument are powered by “Earth current,” which the narrator worries is slowly becoming dimmer over the years. The pyramid itself is a jewel of imagination: described as miles wide and miles high, each layer is its own city, and it continues deep underground where artificial grow chambers provide food for millions of humans.</p>
			<p>Though the novel maintains a sort of legendary status for its grim and imaginative depiction of a monstrous future world, critics acknowledge the work as a flawed masterpiece. The narrative is written in a highly affected style, perhaps meant to emulate 17th century speech, or perhaps meant to be a stylized form of speech used by far-future humans. In any case, it resembles no <em>real</em> style of English, past or present. While some critics praise this style as uniquely atmospheric, others point to it, along with the lack of dialog or proper names, as some of the book’s more difficult aspects. Critics also frequently cite the book’s highly repetitious nature, simplistic characterization, and inordinate length—nearly 200,000 words—as major flaws. But despite whatever flaws the novel may have, the awesome vision of <i>The Night Land</i> remains a marvel to behold.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor Irish rogue tries to win fame and fortune in the 18th-century English aristocracy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</i> was first published as a serial in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>, then later as a complete volume entitled <i>The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.</i>—a title Thackeray disliked, but that was selected by his publisher. Thackeray had great difficulty composing the novel, and found himself frequently frustrated in his attempts to get Barry out of yet another jam. Ultimately he was displeased with his work, and considered it one of his lesser novels.</p>
			<p>Despite Thackeray’s neglect, <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is a bright satire filled with many genuinely funny moments. Barry is the quintessential unreliable narrator, and through his outrageous boasts and tall tales he becomes not just the target of the satire, but its very agent as well. Fortunately modern critics have viewed <i>Barry Lyndon</i> in a much more favorable light than Thackeray’s contemporaries, and even Thackeray himself: today it’s considered by some critics as one of his finest works.</p>

		<summary type="text">A domestic satire set in England before the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Vanity Fair</i> is perhaps Thackeray’s most famous novel. First serialized over the course of 19 volumes in <i>Punch Magazine</i> and first printed as a single volume in 1849, the novel cemented Thackeray’s literary fame and kept him busy with frequent revisions and even lecture circuits.</p>
			<p>The story is framed as a puppet play, narrated by an unreliable narrator, that presents the story of Becky Sharp and Emmy Sedley and the people in their lives as they struggle through the Napoleonic Wars. The story itself, like many other Thackeray novels, is a satire of the lives of the Victorian English of a certain class. Thackeray packed the novel with allusions, many of which were difficult even for his contemporary readers; part of the heavy revisions he later made were making the allusions more accessible to his evolving audience.</p>
			<p>As part of his satirical bent, Thackeray made a point to make each character flawed, so that there are no “heroes” in the book—hence the subtitle “A Novel Without a Hero.” Thackeray’s goal was not only to entertain, but to instruct; to that end, he wanted the reader to look within themselves after finishing the unhappy conclusion, in which there’s no hint as to how society might be able to improve on the evils shadowed in the events of novel.</p>
			<p><i>Vanity Fair</i> received glowing praise by its critical contemporaries, and remains a popular book well into modern times, having been adapted repeatedly for film, radio, and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful woman escapes a life of servitude under an evil witch to adventure through a series of magical islands.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Water of the Wondrous Isles</i> is a landmark in fantasy fiction. First published a year after Morris’s death in 1897 by Kelmscott Press—Morris’s own printing company—the novel follows Birdalone, a young girl who is stolen as a baby by a witch who takes her to serve in the woods of Evilshaw.</p>
			<p>After she encounters a wood fairy that helps her escape the witch’s clutches, Birdalone embarks on a series of adventures across the titular Wondrous Isles. These isles are used by Morris both as parables for contemporary Britain and as vehicles for investigating his radical socialist beliefs. As Birdalone travels through the isles she slowly evolves into the embodiment of the Victorian “new woman,” embracing hard physical labor, healthy exercise, higher education, socialist values, and financial freedom, while rejecting sexual exploitation, physical abuse of both women and children, and the restrictive sexual mores of the era. This makes her unique in the fantasy fiction of the era as one of the genre’s first examples of a strong female hero.</p>
			<p>This socialist-feminist allegory is presented in an Arthurian-style fantasy world complete with magic, witches, fairies, knights both chivalrous and evil, and castles (indeed, anyone doubting the allegorical nature of the work only needs to look at the name of the tale’s main redoubt: “The Castle of the Quest”). The language is purposefully archaic, reveling in vocabulary drawn from the language’s Anglo roots; and the prose is lent a hypnotic quality by its lack of quotation marks to offset dialog, and its short chapters characterized by a fairy-tale-narrative voice.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adventurer comes to an enchanted castle, where he must rescue a fair maiden from the clutches of an enchantress.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>William Morris is famous in no small part for his contributions to defining the genre of modern fantasy literature, and <i>The Wood Beyond the World</i> is a classic example of that influence. Written in a purposefully-antiquated prose style reminiscent of Sir Thomas Malory or other aged fairy tales, <i>The Wood Beyond the World</i> can be difficult for some readers; but those who follow through will enjoy a charming and influential series of picaresque adventures.</p>
			<p>The book follows Golden Walter, a man leaving home who finds himself swept away to an enchanted land. He encounters a fair maiden who is trapped by an enchantress and her consort. Walter must, like all good heroes, save the maiden and see if they can make it to happily ever after.</p>

		<summary type="text">Shakepeare’s 1599 play chronicling the history of King Henry the Fifth and his famous victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written by William Shakespeare around 1599, <i>The Life of Henry the Fifth</i>, more commonly known as <i>Henry V</i>, chronicles the later history of King Henry the Fifth of England and his efforts during Hundred Years’ War to reclaim disputed territories in France. The play starts with Henry’s claims to to be the rightful heir to the French throne and, after his invasion of France, culminates with his famous and improbable victory at the Battle of Agincourt and the negotiation of the Treaty of Troyes.</p>
			<p><i>Henry V</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1599 and first appears in a “bad” quarto in 1600, so-called because it contains a shortened version, likely unauthorized and potentially just based on a performance. This quarto was republished again in 1602 by a different printer and again in 1619. The first definitive text is the version published in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>.</p>
			<p>The play is the last part of a series of four history plays written by Shakespeare, including <i>Richard II</i>, <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i>, and <i>Henry IV, Part 2</i> and many of characters like Henry (who appears as a wild young Hal in the <i>Henry IV</i>s), Pistol, Bardolph, and Mistress Quickly would have therefore been familiar to the audience. It contains some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines and is often held up as a powerful portrayal of inspirational leadership.</p>

		<summary type="text">One couple is tricked into falling in love, and another couple is tricked into falling out of love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Shakespeare wrote <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> towards the middle of his career, sometime between 1598 and 1599. It was first published in quarto in 1600 and later collected into <i>Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies</i> in 1623. The earliest recorded performance of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> was performed for the newly-married Princess Elizabeth and Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine in 1613.</p>
			<p>Shakespeare’s sources of inspiration for this play can be found in Italian culture and popular texts published in the sixteenth century. Gossip involving lovers deceived into believing each other false was often spread throughout Northern Italy. Works like Ludovico Ariosto’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> and Edmund Spencer’s <i>Fearie Queene</i> also feature tricked lovers like Claudio and Hero. Besides these similarities, the idea of tricking a couple like Benedick and Beatrice into <em>falling in love</em> was an original and unusual idea at the time.</p>
			<p>The play focuses on two couples: upon the noblemen’s return to Messina, Claudio and Hero quickly fall in love and wish to marry in a week; on the contrary, Benedick and Beatrice resume their verbal war, exchanging insults with each other. To pass the time prior to the marriage a plot to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love has been set in motion. Unbeknownst to both our couples, a fouler plot to crush the love and happiness between Hero and Claudio has also begun to unfold.</p>

		<summary type="text">Sir John Falstaff runs astray of the denizens of Windsor by trying to seduce several local wives at once.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>First published in 1602 by William Shakespeare, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> features the popular figure Sir John Falstaff, who first appeared in <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i> and <i>Part 2</i>. Some speculate that <i>Merry Wives</i> was written at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, who wanted to see Falstaff in love; and that Shakespeare was forced to rush its creation as a result, and so it remains one of Shakespeare’s lesser-regarded plays.</p>
			<p>The play revolves around two intertwined plots: the adventures of the rogue Falstaff who plans to seduce several local wives, and the story of young Anne Page who is being wooed by prominent citizens while she has her sights set on young Fenton. The wives come together to teach Falstaff a lesson, and in the end love triumphs.</p>
			<p><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1597 and was subsequently published in quarto in 1602, in a second quarto in 1619, and then in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>. Despite holding a lesser place in Shakespeare’s canon, it was one of the first Shakespearean plays to be performed in 1660, after the reinstatement of Charles II and theatre once again was permitted to be performed in London.</p>

		<summary type="text">Wollaston attempts to derive ethics and religion by using rational thought and observation of the natural world, without resorting to revelation or received religion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Wollaston attempts to determine what rules for the conduct of life (that is, what <em>religion</em>) a conscientious and penetrating observer might derive simply from reasoning about the facts of the world around him, without benefit of divine revelation. He concludes that truth, reason, and morality coincide, and that the key to human happiness and ethical behavior is this: “let us by no act deny anything to be true which is true; that is: let us act according to reason.”</p>
			<p>This book was important to the intellectual foundations of the American Revolution (for example, the phrase “the pursuit of happiness” originates here). It also anticipates Kant’s theory of the categorical imperative and the modern libertarian non-aggression principle.</p>
			<p>This edition improves on its predecessors by, for the first time, providing both translations and sources for the over 650 footnotes that, in Wollaston’s original, are cryptically-attributed Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of pastoral poems that is considered the defining text for the beginning of Romantic-era literature.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and his friend and contemporary Samuel Taylor Coleridge. A hugely influential work, <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is generally acknowledged to have started the Romantic movement in English literature—a period marked by a departure from the stiff and unapproachable poetry of earlier times, and by a focus on readable, relatable verse written in everyday language. Many of Wordsworth’s poems focus on the natural world and the down-to-earth people of the country, another far departure from the rational and dry literature of old. Romanticism was one of the largest sea changes in modern English literature, and <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> was its catalyst.</p>
			<p>This ebook edition is based on the 1805 edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, and features the famous poems <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, “Tintern Abbey,” “Expostulation and Reply,” “Lucy Gray,” and many others.</p>
