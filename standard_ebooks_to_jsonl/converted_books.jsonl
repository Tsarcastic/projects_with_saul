Markham tells of the arrival of a young widow, Mrs. Graham, in his rural neighborhood. She brings with her her five year old son Arthur and takes up residence in the partly-ruined Wildfell Hall. Gossip soon begins to swirl around her, questioning her mysterious background and the closeness of her relationship with her landlord Frederick Lawrence. Dismissing these concerns, Gilbert Markham becomes deeply enamored of Helen Graham, and she seems to return his affection strongly. He however becomes increasingly suspicious and jealous of Lawrence, who makes frequent visits to the Hall. He secretly espies them walking together one night, apparently in a romantic relationship. After he confronts Helen over this, she gives him her diary of the last few years and tells him to read it to understand everything.

Holmes, alongside his friend and biographer Dr. John Watson, appeared in two initial novels and dozens of short stories serialised in popular magazines, attracting a devoted, almost fanatical following which continues to this day.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, serialised in 1901&#8211;1902, was the third novel featuring Holmes and Watson. Sherlock Holmes is consulted in his Baker Street apartment by a Dr. Mortimer, a physician now living on the fringes of Dartmoor. He gives Holmes and Watson an account of a centuries-old legend. The story tells of a hell-hound which slaughtered the debauched heir of the Baskerville family who had been in lecherous pursuit of an innocent maiden across the moor. The same hound is reputed to have harrowed several of the subsequent heirs to the estate.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This ancient story might be dismissed as mere fancy, but for the fact that the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville recently died in very mysterious circumstances, apparently fleeing in terror from something which came from the moor. Dr. Mortimer is concerned that the new heir, Sir Henry, just returned from Canada, may be at risk from this supernatural beast. Holmes is intrigued, but being too busy to go himself, sends Dr. Watson to accompany Sir Henry to the ancestral home on Dartmoor and to report anything suspicious.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> is arguably the best and most certainly the most popular of Doyle&#8217;s novels featuring his iconic detective.

The first British edition omitted the story &#8220;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&#8221; which appeared in <i>The Strand</i> in 1893. This story did appear in the very first American edition of the collection, immediately following &#8220;Silver Blaze,&#8221; but it was quickly replaced by a revised edition which omitted it.

The story originally appeared over several issues of the monthly <i>Strand Magazine</i> in late 1914 before being published as a standalone novel. While Doyle would continue to publish Sherlock Holmes short stories until 1927, <i>The Valley of Fear</i> remains Holmes&#8217; final novel appearance.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the first half of the novel, Holmes and his assistant Watson are called to assist with an investigation into the murder of John Douglas, a man apparently shot in his own home at point-blank range with a shotgun. The blast leaves little trace of a skull with which to identify him. As evidence is examined and witnesses within the house are questioned, Holmes uncovers holes in testimonies and a connection to a secret society that no one wishes to discuss.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The second half of the novel elucidates the back-story of the apparent murder victim, Douglas. Years prior, Douglas had been in Chicago, on the run from the law. Wandering under the name John McMurdo, Douglas identifies himself to the local chapter of the Eminent Order of Freemen as a member from another region. The group is known by the locals as &#8220;the Scowrers,&#8221; who terrorize and extort the townspeople like a mafia under the ruthless Councilor McGinty. McMurdo, no stranger to violence, joins the employ of the Scowrers and participates in an assault on a local newspaper editor. While McMurdo tries to elevate his status within the local order, other members begin to wonder if the group&#8217;s actions are getting too brazenly violent, lest they force the intervention of government officials beyond the reach of their bribery. Douglas&#8217; character draws inspiration from the real-life story of James McParland, an American private detective and Pinkerton agent.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3776", "https://archive.org/details/valleyfearasher00doylgoog"], "categories": ["Holmes, Sherlock (Fictitious character) -- Fiction", "Private investigators -- England -- Fiction", "Detective and mystery stories"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear/dist/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear.azw3"]}

Here Comte lays down the various tenents of the philosophy, describing what he views as the six major characteristics of the system. Comte goes into surprising detail, going so far as to describe minutae like how children should be educated, the structure of a unified global committee of nations, new flags, calendars, the role of the arts, and so on. He ends the book with what he calls the &#8220;Religion of Humanity,&#8221; a secular religion meant to replace the traditional religions that people of the time were becoming disillusioned with.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book and the theory are both very much products of the time. Comte was born around the end of the French Revolution, and lived in Paris during that time when republican ideas, respect for science, and a revolutionary and forward-thinking spirit made fertile ground for change. He viewed Positivism as the single solution to most of the problems of the day, including Communism, the plight of the working class, the shift away from traditional religion, and the constant war and strife that had plagued humanity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Comte&#8217;s theories gained a huge following: you might even recognize the Positivist motto, &#8220;Order and Progress,&#8221; inscribed on Brazil&#8217;s national flag. While Positivism and its executive arm, the Church of Humanity, today only seem to survive in any significant number in Brazil&#8212;and even there in a greatly declined state&#8212;its theories were hugely influential in the emergence of many &#8220;ethical societies&#8221; and secular church movements around the globe.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53799", "https://books.google.com/books?id=v6ZJAAAAIAAJ"], "categories": ["Philosophy"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/auguste-comte_a-general-view-of-positivism.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/auguste-comte_a-general-view-of-positivism.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/auguste-comte_a-general-view-of-positivism.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte/a-general-view-of-positivism/j-h-bridges/dist/auguste-comte_a-general-view-of-positivism.azw3"]}

Born into a Jewish family, he converted to Anglican Christianity as a child. He is now almost certainly most famous for his political career. Becoming a member of the British Parliament at the age of 33, he initially rose to prominence within the Conservative (&#8220;Tory&#8221;) party because of his clashes with the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. Rising to lead the Conservative Party, Disraeli became Prime Minister for a short period in 1868, and then for an extended period between 1874 and 1880. He became friendly with Queen Victoria and was appointed Earl of Beaconsfield by her in 1876.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>However, Disraeli was much more than a politician. He wrote both political treatises and no less than seventeen novels during his lifetime, of which <i>Sybil, or The Two Nations</i> is now among the best regarded. The &#8220;Two Nations&#8221; of the subtitle refer to the divisions in Britain between the rich and the poor, each of whom might as well be living in a different country from the other. In the novel, Disraeli highlights the terrible living conditions of the poor and the shocking injustices of how they were treated by most employers and land-owners. He contrasts this with the frivolous, pampered livestyles of the aristocracy. He covers the rise of the Chartist movement, which was demanding universal manhood suffrage&#8212;the right for all adult men to vote, regardless of whether they owned property&#8212;and other reforms to enable working men a voice in the government of the country. (Female suffrage was to come much later). The upheavals of the time led to the development of the People&#8217;s Charter and a massive petition with millions of signatures being presented to Parliament. However the Parliament of the time refused to even consider the petition, triggering violent protests in Birmingham and elsewhere. All of this is well covered and explained in the novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Sybil</i> is rather disjointed in structure as it ranges over these different topics, but the main plot revolves around Egremont, the younger son of a nobleman, who encounters some of the leaders of the workers&#8217; movement and in particular Walter Gerard, one of the most respected of these leaders, whom Egremont befriends while concealing his real name and social position. During visits to Gerard under an assumed name, Egremont falls for the beautiful and saintly Sybil, Gerard&#8217;s daughter, but she rejects him when his true identity is exposed. Sybil subsequently undergoes many difficult trials as the people&#8217;s movement develops and comes into conflict with the authorities.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760", "https://books.google.com.au/books?id=r99FAAAAcAAJ"], "categories": ["England -- Fiction", "Love stories", "Landlord and tenant -- Fiction", "Poor families -- Fiction", "Political fiction", "Rich people -- Fiction", "Social classes -- Fiction", "Chartism -- Fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/benjamin-disraeli_sybil.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/benjamin-disraeli_sybil.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/benjamin-disraeli_sybil.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli/sybil/dist/benjamin-disraeli_sybil.azw3"]}

Though very difficult to summarise, the novel centers around the decades-long legal case of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>, involving the fair distribution of assets of a valuable estate. The case is mired in the legal quagmire of the Court of Chancery, whose byzantine and sluggish workings Dickens spares no effort to expose and condemn. Dickens also exposes the miserable condition of the poor, living in squalid, pestilential circumstances.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel&#8217;s heroine is Esther Summerson, whose parentage is unclear and who has been brought up by a cold and strict godmother, who tells her only: &#8220;Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.&#8221; On the death of her godmother, she is given an education through the unexpected intervention of a Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, whom she has never met.

It&#8217;s set in Coketown, a fictional mill-town set in the north of England. One of the major themes of the book is the miserable treatment of workers in the mills, and the resistance to their unionization by the mill owners, typified by the character Josiah Bounderby, who absurdly asserts that the workers live a near-idyllic life but they all &#8220;expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon.&#8221; The truth, of course, is far different.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The other major topic which Dickens tackles in this novel is the rationalist movement in schooling and the denigration of imagination and fantasy. It begins with the words &#8220;Now, what I want is, Facts,&#8221; spoken by the wealthy magnate Thomas Gradgrind, who is supervising a class at a model school he has opened. This indeed is Gradgrind&#8217;s entire philosophy. &#8220;Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.&#8221; He is supported and encouraged in this approach by his friend Bounderby. Grandgrind raises his own children on these principles, and, as we discover, in doing so blights their lives.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel also follows the story of a particular mill-worker, Stephen Blackpool, who leads a tragic life. He is burdened with an alcoholic, slatternly wife, who is mostly absent from his life, but who returns at irregular intervals to trouble him. This existing marriage, and the near-impossibility of divorce for someone of his class, prevents him marrying Rachel, who is the light of his life. Dickens depicts Stephen as representing the nobility of honest work, and contrasts his character with that of the self-satisfied humbug Josiah Bounderby who represents the worst aspects of capitalism.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/786", "https://archive.org/details/hardtimes1854dick"], "categories": ["England -- Fiction", "Domestic fiction", "Social problems -- Fiction", "Utilitarianism -- Fiction", "Education -- Fiction", "Political fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/charles-dickens_hard-times.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/charles-dickens_hard-times.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/charles-dickens_hard-times.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/hard-times/dist/charles-dickens_hard-times.azw3"]}

He is raised in miserable conditions, half-starved, and then sent out as an apprentice to an undertaker. Running away from this situation, he walks to London and falls under the influence of a criminal gang run by an old man called Fagin, who wants to employ the child as a pickpocket.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel graphically depicts the wretched living conditions of much of the poor people of Victorian times and the disgusting slums in which they were forced to live.

Each involves an element of magic, be it a vine that dooms those who eat from it or a man transformed into a tree to avoid being separated from his wife. Julius&#8217;s audience, a married couple who have just moved to the South to cultivate grapes, listen on with mixed sympathy and disbelief. They disagree on whether Julius is telling the truth and whether there is some deeper significance to the tales. At turns humorous and unsettling, these stories provide a surprising lens into the realities of slavery.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The text is notable for spelling out Julius&#8217;s spoken accent. Although Julius has some stereotypical features of a simple-minded old slave, he is often regarded as a more clever and complicated figure. He seems to tell his tales not only to entertain his listeners, but to trick them to his advantage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Many of these stories first appeared in national magazines, where they received popular acclaim, before being assembled as their own volume in 1899. Charles W. Chesnutt&#8217;s race was not mentioned by the publisher, nor could many guess his African heritage based on his appearance.

Published under her pseudonym of &#8220;Currer Bell,&#8221; it differs in several respects from that earlier work. It is written in the third person with an omniscient narrator, rather than the first-person of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and incorporates the themes of industrial change and the plight of unemployed workers. It also features strong pleas for the recognition of women&#8217;s intellect and right to their independence of thought and action.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Set in the West Riding of Yorkshire during the Napoleonic period of the early 19th Century, the novel describes the confrontations between textile manufacturers and organized groups of workers protesting the introduction of mechanical looms. Three characters stand out: Robert Moore, a mill-owner determined to introduce modern methods despite sometimes violent opposition; his young cousin Caroline Helstone, who falls deeply in love with Robert; and Shirley Keeldar, a rich heiress who comes to live in the estate of Fieldhead, on whose land Robert&#8217;s mill stands. Robert&#8217;s business is in trouble, not so much because of the protests of the workers but because of a government decree which prevents him selling his finished cloth overseas during the duration of the war with Napoleon. He receives a loan from Miss Keeldar, and her interest in him seems to be becoming a romantic one, much to the distress of Caroline, who pines away for lack of any sign of affection from Robert.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Shirley Keeldar is a remarkable female character for the time: strong, very independent-minded, dismissive of much of the standard rules of society, and determined to decide on her own future. Interestingly, up to this point, the name &#8220;Shirley&#8221; was almost entirely a male name; Shirley&#8217;s parents had hoped for a boy.

As in her other children&#8217;s books, it begins in the everyday world but quickly brings in the fantastical and magical. A large part of the delight of Nesbit&#8217;s books is that her children behave in quite ordinary ways, getting into scrapes, getting dirty and their clothes torn, making decisions which seem right to them at the time but which are generally wrong-headed. It&#8217;s the contrast between the ordinariness of the children and the magical adventures they become involved in which makes the books so charming.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> alongside stories by Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle. The first book edition was published in 1907.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the story, Kathleen and her brothers Gerald and Jimmy find a way into a remarkable garden designed to create a Palladian landscape, full of statues and pseudo-Classical temples and buildings. It is not long before they come across a sleeping Princess. They wake her, and she introduces them to an item of real magical value, a ring which makes its wearer invisible. But once on, the ring won&#8217;t come off! &#8220;Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole business is,&#8221; comments the author, which is indicative of the simple and direct language she uses, and the humor of the books.

The life and liberty of Hatteras&#8217; lady-love are imperilled as Nikola&#8217;s plot moves on, and Hatteras has to make strenuous efforts to locate and free her.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Boothby&#8217;s novels, particularly the Dr. Nikola books, achieved considerable popular success, particularly in his native country of Australia. A study of library borrowings in the early 20th Century has shown that Boothby&#8217;s works were almost as frequently borrowed in Australia as those of Charles Dickens and H. Rider Haggard.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0601591h.html", "https://archive.org/details/abidforfortuneo00woodgoog"], "categories": ["Fiction", "Detective and mystery stories"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/guy-boothby_a-bid-for-fortune.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/guy-boothby_a-bid-for-fortune.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/guy-boothby_a-bid-for-fortune.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby/a-bid-for-fortune/dist/guy-boothby_a-bid-for-fortune.azw3"]}

In contrast to Wells&#8217; early speculative fiction works like <i>The Time Machine</i>, this is a comic novel set in the everyday world of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in England. Despite the less than happy life-story of Mr. Polly, it is an amusing book, enlivened by Polly&#8217;s inventive attitude towards the English language.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Alfred Polly&#8217;s mother dies when he is only seven, and he is brought up by his father and a stern aunt. He is indifferently educated, and leaves school in his early teens to be employed as a draper&#8217;s assistant. As the years pass, he finds himself more and more disenchanted with his occupation, but it is too late to change it. Eventually his father dies and leaves him a legacy which may be enough to set up in business for himself. He sets up his own shop in a small town and stumbles into an unhappy marriage. The business is not profitable, and in his middle-age, unhappy and dyspeptic, Mr. Polly comes up with an idea to bring an end to his troubles. Things, however, do not go as he planned, and lead to an unexpected result.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Wells&#8217; later work often displays his passion for social reform.

G. Wells, published in the same year as <i>The Time Machine</i>. It takes a gentle, semi-comic approach to some of Wells&#8217; social concerns by using the device of an angel fallen into our world from the Land of Dreams. This external observer, largely ignorant of the ways of humans and our society, is able to focus an unbiased eye on our failings.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story opens with a strange glare over the little village of Sidderford one night, observed by only a few. But then reports arise of a Strange Bird being seen in the woods. The Rev. Hilyer, the Vicar of Sidderford, is a keen ornithologist. He takes his gun and goes out to hunt this unusual specimen for his collection. He does indeed see a strange flying creature, shoots at it, and brings it down. To his horror, he finds that he has shot and wounded a man-like creature with wings&#8212;in fact, an Angel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The Vicar restores the Angel to health, but finds himself incapable of convincing others that this person really is an angel. The continuing clashes of the Angel&#8217;s idealistic points of view with the harsh reality of the human world are the core of this story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> was well-received by critics and Wells&#8217; contemporaries.

Synge first presented <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on the 26th of January, 1907. The performance immediately offended Irish nationalists by seemingly insulting the Irish people and language, and the general public, by being an offense against moral order. Before it was even finished, it was disrupted by a riot that soon spread out into the city. When it was performed in 1911 in the U.S., the play was again greeted with scorn and the company arrested for an immoral performance.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But as Synge himself attempts to explain in the preface to his play, rather than attack Irish Gaelic, he wanted to show the relationship between the imagination of the Irish country people and their speech, which is &#8220;rich and living,&#8221; and that his use of such language reflects reality in a way missing from other modern drama. He later insisted that his plot was not to be taken as social realism, but died in 1909 before the play finally gained broader appeal in the wider world.

It came at a decisive time in the history of western thought: the melding of Faith, Philosophy, and Science into a post-enlightenment rational view of the universe. In some sense mankind had just begun to believe he had the universe figured out when the universe struck back with a tragedy so terrible in scale it could not be fit into any box of understanding. It was not predicted. It could not have been prevented. It was not rational. And it certainly could not have been the will of a benevolent God.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lisbon was only one moment in a much larger context&#8212;industrialization was upending a pre-historic way of life, science was upending nature, and the first great republics in America and France were about to upend previously unchalleneged forms of government. It was the awe, inspiration, and uncertainty of all this change that gave rise, ultimately, to Romanticism in art, literature, and music.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>J. W. von Goethe is, by some accounts, the father of the romantic period in literature, or at least the proto-romantic <i xml:lang=\"de\">Sturm und Drang</i> (&#8220;Storm and Stress&#8221;) period. And <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> was its genesis. It was Goethe&#8217;s first major work, an immediate sensation upon publication, and made Goethe a household name.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While Voltaire parodied rationalism in <i>Candide</i>, Goethe transcended it with the semi-autobiographical story of Werther, a young man governed more by his emotions than his reason, whose only employment is his delight in the romantic ideals of the pastoral lives he finds in the rural town of Walheim. There he also finds Charlotte, and in her an idealized but unobtainable old-world domesticity. Werther&#8217;s internal dialog about his growing obsession with Charlotte, and his inability to cope rationally with the fact that she is engaged to&#8212;and in love with&#8212;another man, form the bulk of the book in the form of a series of ever more intense letters to a friend.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Werther&#8217;s descent into sorrow has captivated readers for centuries, helped by Goethe&#8217;s intensely beautiful prose (translated here by R. D. Boylan), enchanting imagery, and obvious reverence for nature and a dying past.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007104616"], "categories": ["Germany -- Social life and customs -- Fiction", "Unrequited love -- Fiction", "Young men -- Germany -- Fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/j-w-von-goethe_the-sorrows-of-young-werther.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/j-w-von-goethe_the-sorrows-of-young-werther.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/j-w-von-goethe_the-sorrows-of-young-werther.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe/the-sorrows-of-young-werther/r-d-boylan/dist/j-w-von-goethe_the-sorrows-of-young-werther.azw3"]}

The family is in debt, and in order to save money they rent their noble property to a retired Admiral and his wife. This brings Anne into unexpected and initially unwelcome contact with the brother of the Admiral&#8217;s wife, Captain Frederick Wentworth. Eight years previously, Wentworth had proposed to Anne, only to be rejected by her after she was persuaded by an older friend that he was an unsuitable match. He reacted angrily to this rejection, and she has had no contact with him since.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>At the time Anne rejected him, he was a poor naval officer, without his own command. In the years since, however, during the course of the Napoleonic Wars, he has become rich, as many successful captains did during that period. Anne dreads encountering him again, and when she does, he shows no sign of his earlier affection, instead paying his attentions to Anne&#8217;s younger sisters-in-law, and Anne must keep her emotions under strict control. Time and circumstance eventually lead to happier results.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Persuasion</i> was well-regarded on publication and has slowly increased in popularity since.

Milton&#8217;s vivid and poetic description of these events is both dramatic and compelling.

During that time, Muir took every opportunity to explore the Yosemite area extensively&#8212;hiking, camping, writing, and sketching. Muir&#8217;s diary entries describing the land, flora, and fauna he encountered became the basis for the book <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, first published in 1911.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Muir&#8217;s journal entries from that summer reveal his growing wonder and awe at the Yosemite landscape, as well as his endless curiosity for the natural world. On a grand scale, he trekked into remote areas for sometimes days at a time. He climbed Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana and trekked through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake. On a more modest scale, Muir observed the flora and fauna that surrounded him with the keen enthusiasm of a naturalist. He described in detail the area&#8217;s trees, shrubs, flowers, mountain meadows, glacial features, and animals.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the years that followed the publication of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, Muir went on to advocate for the protection and preservation of wild landscapes. In 1892, Muir co-founded the Sierra Club and became the organization&#8217;s first president. Muir also played an instrumental role in the establishment of several national parks including Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> remains among John Muir&#8217;s most popular works. The book&#8217;s inspired and lyrical accounts of an iconic wilderness, written at a time in Muir&#8217;s life when his character as a naturalist and wilderness advocate was taking form, earns it a prominent, influential place in the annals of nature writing and the history of wilderness preservation.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32540", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007668397"], "categories": ["Naturalists -- United States -- Biography", "Muir, John, 1838-1914", "Natural history -- Sierra Nevada (Calif. and Nev.)", "Sierra Nevada (Calif. and Nev.)"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/john-muir_my-first-summer-in-the-sierra.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/john-muir_my-first-summer-in-the-sierra.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/john-muir_my-first-summer-in-the-sierra.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir/my-first-summer-in-the-sierra/dist/john-muir_my-first-summer-in-the-sierra.azw3"]}

Ordered by date of first publication, they range from spy adventures to the ultimate expression of corporate warfare and from a very short 1000-word story to full-blown novellas.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29940", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40954", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30035", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29206", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23942", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23929", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24749", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30712", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23669", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27393", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26741", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24247", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30338", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30334", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51799", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30339", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24370", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23197", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23194", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31008", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52995", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59514", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60761", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4aa2556c5cbaf", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID505a4e8aaf930", "https://archive.org/details/1954-01_IF/page/n115", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID49c82d6189993", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID46917350e5c63", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID469171f14fd3f", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID46916599916da", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4914cf86f4221", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4682eef623947", "https://archive.org/details/Amazing_Stories_v34n11_1960-11_UnkSc-cape1736/page/n71", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID48c445cc111b3", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID46d4c9827eadb", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4914d22f3bd3e", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4914ddd4f0ab1", "https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v19n05_1961-06_modified/page/n3", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4914e24d73ccb", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID46e33170e5708", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4671dcb9cec18", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID4671d4f5aee30", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID49443df3561e2", "https://www.pgdp.org/ols/tools/biblio.php?id=projectID57cb212a1c5ba", "https://archive.org/details/1956-06_IF_modified/page/n47/", "https://archive.org/details/1960-01_IF/page/n3/"], "categories": ["Science fiction", "Short stories", "Astronauts -- Fiction", "Political fiction", "Soviet Union -- Fiction", "Soldiers -- Fiction", "Balkan Peninsula -- Fiction", "Sahara -- Fiction", "Sabotage -- Fiction", "Desert reclamation -- Mali -- Fiction", "Time travel -- Fiction", "Assassins -- Fiction", "Science fiction, American", "Space colonies -- Fiction", "Mercenary troops -- Fiction", "Corporations -- Corrupt practices -- Fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/mack-reynolds_short-fiction.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/mack-reynolds_short-fiction.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/mack-reynolds_short-fiction.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds/short-fiction/dist/mack-reynolds_short-fiction.azw3"]}

Ormsby as an annotator deftly explains obscure passages, gives background on the life and times of 1600s Spain, references decisions from other contemporary translators, and doesn&#8217;t hold back from sharing his views on the genius&#8212;and flaws&#8212;of Cervantes&#8217; greatest work. Additionally this edition corrects hundreds of transcription and typography errors present in the source transcription.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story is of the eponymous Don Quixote, a country noble who, in his old age, reads too many chivalric romances and goes mad. After convincing his grubby servant, Sancho Panza, to join him as his squire, he embarks on an absurd and comic quest to do good and right wrongs.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today <i>Don Quixote</i>&#8217;s two volumes are published as a single work, but their publication came ten years apart. Cervantes saw great success with the publication of his first volume, and appeared to have little desire to write a second volume until a different author wrote a spurious, inferior sequel. This kicked Cervantes into gear and he wrote volume two, a more serious and philosophical volume than the largely comic first volume.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite being written in 1605 and translated in 1885, <i>Don Quixote</i> contains a surprising amount of slapstick laughs&#8212;even for the modern reader&#8212;and narrative devices still seen in today&#8217;s fiction, including meta-narratives, frame narratives, and metafiction.

They were published in various popular magazines of the time, as well as in the Houston <i>Post</i>, where they were not attributed to him until many years after his death.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth139429", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2777", "https://archive.org/details/cu31924022067254", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2776", "https://archive.org/details/cu31924012602755", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3707", "https://archive.org/details/cu31924022015394", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1725", "https://archive.org/details/cu31924022025799", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1805", "https://archive.org/details/gentlegrafter02henrgoog", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1444", "https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.93860", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1646", "https://archive.org/details/roadsdestiny00henrgoog", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1583", "https://archive.org/details/cu31924022025807", "https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth139383", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2141", "https://archive.org/details/StrictlyBusiness", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1595", "https://archive.org/details/whirligigs02henrgoog", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2851", "https://archive.org/details/sixesandsevens00henrgoog", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3815", "https://archive.org/details/rollingstones04henrgoog", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2295", "https://archive.org/details/waifsandstrayst00henrgoog", "https://archive.org/details/ohenryanaseveno00presgoog", "https://archive.org/details/postscripts00henr", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007926272"], "categories": ["Fiction", "Short Stories, American"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/o-henry_short-fiction.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/o-henry_short-fiction.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/o-henry_short-fiction.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry/short-fiction/dist/o-henry_short-fiction.azw3"]}

His observations have proved invaluable in establishing an accurate record of the daily life of the people of London of that period.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Pepys eventually stopped writing his diary due to progressively worse eyesight, a condition he feared. He did consider employing an amanuensis to transcribe future entries for him, but worried that the content he wanted written would be too personal.

In them Grant, the most able General of the Civil War, tells the story of his life and experiences, covering his birth, early youth, military training at West Point, his involvement as a Lieutenant in the Mexican War of 1847&#8211;48, and of course, his role in the Civil War of 1861&#8211;65, during which he rose to become the supreme commander of the Northern forces. After the Mexican War, Grant had left military service and became, essentially, an unsuccessful shopkeeper. Re-enlisting at the start of the Civil War, he rose to his ultimate position entirely on his own merits, showing himself to be a skilled strategist and a master of logistics.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>What distinguishes Grant&#8217;s <i>Personal Memoirs</i>, and makes them a clear candidate for being considered a part of American literature, is the high quality and interest of the writing, for which Grant clearly had a talent. Though he goes into an extremely high level of detail about the military movements and struggles of the Civil War, the book is full of interest, and in parts is as gripping as a novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Obviously, Grant tells only his own part of the story and from the perspective of the ultimately successful forces; but his humanity shows through in the respect he offers to those on the other side, and in his acknowledgment of their sufferings, despite his clear condemnation of their cause of preserving slavery. He is generous in awarding due credit to others on his own side, and where blame is due tempering it with his understanding of that person&#8217;s character, background and circumstances.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After the war, Grant served two terms as President of the United States between 1869&#8211;77, but his <i>Memoirs</i> do not deal with this period.

Like many of his other novels it has a complex plot and tackles social issues, in this case the then-lax state of the marriage laws, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. As always, Collins deals carefully but frankly with human personal behavior. To avoid offending Victorian morals too greatly, much is implied rather than stated outright. Nevertheless, even dealing with such matters at all led to his novels being derided as &#8220;sensation ficton&#8221; by his critics. By today&#8217;s standards, of course, they wouldn&#8217;t even raise an eyebrow.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>Man and Wife</i>, the main character Anne Silvester has fallen pregnant to a muscular and handsome, but boorish man, Geoffrey Delamayn, to whom she is not married. She is working as a governess at a house in Scotland. Anne arranges to meet Delamayn secretly at a garden party and angrily demands that he fulfill his promise to marry her, that very day. He very reluctantly agrees to a secret, private marriage, knowing that a public marriage would badly affect his inheritance prospects. How is the marriage to be arranged quickly but kept quiet? Anne has a plan based on her understanding of the looseness of the marriage laws in Scotland. Naturally, of course, things go badly wrong with this plan and many complexities arise.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Collins is deeply critical of the state of contemporary marriage laws, both in how loosely they were framed, and in how little power over their own lives they gave to women once they were married, even if married to a brutal man. He also uses this novel to denounce the worship of sporting heroes and the obsession with physical prowess rather than mental superiority as a primary indication of male virtue.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though not as popular as his novels <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white\"><i>The Woman in White</i></a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone\"><i>The Moonstone</i></a>, <i>Man and Wife</i> received a good critical reception when it was released and was a commercial success.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1586", "https://archive.org/details/manandwife00colliala"], "categories": ["England -- Fiction", "Domestic fiction", "Married women -- Fiction", "Bigamy -- Fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/wilkie-collins_man-and-wife.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/wilkie-collins_man-and-wife.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/wilkie-collins_man-and-wife.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/man-and-wife/dist/wilkie-collins_man-and-wife.azw3"]}

Many years later, estranged from his family due to his licentious lifestyle, the officer bequeaths the diamond to his sister&#8217;s daughter, Rachel Verrinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday. Due to the ill-omens surrounding the gem, this may have been an act of revenge rather than reconciliation. The diamond, it appears, was taken from a statue of the Moon God worshipped by a Hindu cult, and it has long been sought by a group of Brahmins determined to return it to their temple.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the night of the birthday party the gem mysteriously disappears from Rachel&#8217;s room. While the first suspicions naturally fall on these Indians, they are eventually exculpated. Rachel becomes hysterical and angry when questioned about the theft and refuses to assist the police. Active efforts to assist them are taken up by Rachel&#8217;s cousin (and sweetheart) Franklin Blake. These efforts simply drive Rachel into further fury, and she becomes completely estranged from him. Suspicion thus falls on her as having some secret reason for wishing to raise money on the diamond. The novel proceeds to slowly uncover the mysteries involved.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Published in 1868, <i>The Moonstone</i> is often considered as one of the precursors of the modern detective novel, though this is a label which would not have been used by its author Wilkie Collins and his contemporaries. While it is true that the plot revolves around the mystery of a theft, and that it features Sergeant Cuff &#8220;in the Detective Force of Scotland Yard,&#8221; the novel is much more about character and relationships than the mere revelation of secrets. It also has a good dose of Collins&#8217; humour, as the story is told in large part by eccentric characters such as the old house-steward Gabriel Betteredge who regards <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> as an oracle; and the ultra-religious Miss Clack, determined to convert everyone to her views.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Immensely popular at the time of its publication in serial form, <i>The Moonstone</i> is rightly considered to be one of Collins&#8217; best works, and remains highly regarded today.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/155", "https://archive.org/details/156979296.1876.emory.edu", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100822566"], "categories": ["England -- Fiction", "Country homes -- Fiction", "Police -- England -- Fiction", "Jewelry theft -- Fiction", "East Indians -- England -- Fiction"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/wilkie-collins_the-moonstone.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/wilkie-collins_the-moonstone.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/wilkie-collins_the-moonstone.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone/dist/wilkie-collins_the-moonstone.azw3"]}

Williams is recognized as one of the foremost poets of American Modernism. In these collections a reader may perceive Williams&#8217; contact with and subsequent growth through and away from Imagism. The poet&#8217;s work asserts a decidedly American approach to Modernism and features highly localized diction and imagery.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>William Carlos Williams was born in 1883, grew up in New Jersey, and was educated in Europe and the United States. He was friends with Hilda Doolittle &#8220;H. D.&#8221; and Ezra Pound, and through these friendships was introduced to Imagism. He eventually broke with the Imagists and invested himself instead in capturing the unique diction and linguistic intermingling of the United States, while remaining committed to the concreteness that characterizes Imagism. A practising doctor, Williams included many images of bodies, sickness, and medical care in his early poems. Williams later claimed there are &#8220;no ideas but in things,&#8221; a sentiment rooted in both his contact with Imagism and his firm sense of place.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Williams continued to read and respond to expatriate and English Modernism, culminating in his long work <i>Paterson</i>. In his later career Williams influenced postwar literary movements, most notably the Beat Generation. He died in 1963.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31878", "https://archive.org/details/temperscarlos00willrich/", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51997", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006060238", "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35667", "https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007676947"], "categories": ["American poetry", "American poetry -- 20th century"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/william-carlos-williams_poetry.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/william-carlos-williams_poetry.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/william-carlos-williams_poetry.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams/poetry/dist/william-carlos-williams_poetry.azw3"]}

Published in 1912, the book introduces a 17th-century gentleman who loses his wife. He soon discovers himself somehow reanimated in Earth&#8217;s far future, millions of years from now, when the sun has died and the Earth has become a hellish waste. What remains of humanity lives in titanic mile-high pyramids surrounded by energy shields to protect them from the abhuman monsters lurking in the darkness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The human survivors soon receive a distress signal sent by a long-forgotten lesser pyramid, and the narrator embarks on a bloody quest to rescue the maiden of the pyramid&#8212;which he knows to be his lost love, somehow transcending time and space. On his journey the narrator is beset by countless horrifying monsters, many of them mutated former-humans. These depictions are so singular that H. P. Lovecraft called <i>The Night Land</i> &#8220;one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written.&#8221;</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is unique in its farsighted depiction of technology. The narrator has telepathic powers and is able to communicate with others over long distances. These powers are enabled by his &#8220;brain elements,&#8221; which are possibly surgically-implanted. Telepathic communications may be spied upon by the monsters of the waste, but a &#8220;master word&#8221; sent by the caller may verify the integrity of the signal&#8212;a description of a kind of early public-key cryptography.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The narrator survives on food pellets and &#8220;powdered water,&#8221; predicting a kind of astronaut food. His weapon of choice is a Diskos, a kind of whirling razor-sharp blade that shoots fire and energy. The machines and force fields of the human pyramid monument are powered by &#8220;Earth current,&#8221; which the narrator worries is slowly becoming dimmer over the years. The pyramid itself is a jewel of imagination: described as miles wide and miles high, each layer is its own city, and it continues deep underground where artificial grow chambers provide food for millions of humans.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though the novel maintains a sort of legendary status for its grim and imaginative depiction of a monstrous future world, critics acknowledge the work as a flawed masterpiece. The narrative is written in a highly affected style, perhaps meant to emulate 17th century speech, or perhaps meant to be a stylized form of speech used by far-future humans. In any case, it resembles no <em>real</em> style of English, past or present. While some critics praise this style as uniquely atmospheric, others point to it, along with the lack of dialog or proper names, as some of the book&#8217;s more difficult aspects. Critics also frequently cite the book&#8217;s highly repetitious nature, simplistic characterization, and inordinate length&#8212;nearly 200,000 words&#8212;as major flaws.

The earliest recorded performance of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> was performed for the newly-married Princess Elizabeth and Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine in 1613.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Shakespeare&#8217;s sources of inspiration for this play can be found in Italian culture and popular texts published in the sixteenth century. Gossip involving lovers deceived into believing each other false was often spread throughout Northern Italy. Works like Ludovico Ariosto&#8217;s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> and Edmund Spencer&#8217;s <i>Fearie Queene</i> also feature tricked lovers like Claudio and Hero. Besides these similarities, the idea of tricking a couple like Benedick and Beatrice into <em>falling in love</em> was an original and unusual idea at the time.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play focuses on two couples: upon the noblemen&#8217;s return to Messina, Claudio and Hero quickly fall in love and wish to marry in a week; on the contrary, Benedick and Beatrice resume their verbal war, exchanging insults with each other. To pass the time prior to the marriage a plot to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love has been set in motion. Unbeknownst to both our couples, a fouler plot to crush the love and happiness between Hero and Claudio has also begun to unfold.</p>\n\t\t", "source": ["https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1519", "https://books.google.com/books?id=FJwMAAAAYAAJ"], "categories": ["Comedies", "Rejection (Psychology) -- Drama", "Conspiracies -- Drama", "Courtship -- Drama", "Messina (Italy) -- Drama"], "links": ["https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/cover.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/cover-thumbnail.jpg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/src/epub/images/cover.svg", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/william-shakespeare_much-ado-about-nothing.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/william-shakespeare_much-ado-about-nothing.epub3", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/william-shakespeare_much-ado-about-nothing.kepub.epub", "https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/much-ado-about-nothing/dist/william-shakespeare_much-ado-about-nothing.azw3"]}
